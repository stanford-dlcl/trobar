 <title>Troubadour Phenomenology: On Being in the Audience</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/troubadour-phenomenology-being-audience</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In this creative essay, I attempted to use take a phenomenological apporach to understanding troubadour performance, with particular regard to the experience of the audience member. I put secondary sources in conversation with my own observations of our group as an audience during the musical performances, lectures, and guided visits we went on this trip. My central argument was that the audience plays as active and critical of a role in constructing a performance as the performer does. The performance space allows for an access to simultaneous subjectivity and objectivity, and it is this inhabiting of multiple perspectives which creates the meaning for each individual who takes part in a performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Borderless: Situating Three Occitanian Crusades</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/borderless-situating-three-occitanian-crusades</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderless&lt;/em&gt; is a mapamundi (medieval-styled world map) that represents Marcabru’s &lt;em&gt;Pax in Nomine Domini&lt;/em&gt; while putting different types of “Occitanian crusades” into conversation. The project is rooted in the idea that sound – language and music – can embody a type of conquest or reclamation. For Marcabru in the 12th century, this manifested itself in the propagandic use of vernacular poetry to incentivize warriors and noblemen to cleanse their sins at a distant “washing place.” For modern Occitanian activists, a crusade is waged against a suffocating French nation-state by promoting the use of Occitan, speaking the language of the land. For refugees, many of whom are Muslim and North African, sustaining mother tongues may be a reclamation of livelihood and identity. In each scenario, goals that are intangible in the moment (the holy land, Occitanian independence, and an end to xenophobia) are turned tangible by the flick of a tongue, the movement of the mouth, the significance of sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Similarly, the map makes tangible the various “holy lands” and utopias of the three crusades. A constellation of symbols can take on a material, physical form just as language is inherently physical. The center of the map is inspired by the Hereford Mapamundi (c. 1300), which centers Jerusalem and provides a whole timeline of Christian thought from the birth of Christ to his resurrection. The map’s toponyms were inspired both by the places mentioned in &lt;em&gt;Pax in Nomine Domini &lt;/em&gt;and by our trips to various keeps and cities over the seminar. In the end, the piece offers a space for the confluence of three different struggles that, at one point or another, have gripped the “Other France.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bibliography&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Barton, Simon. &lt;em&gt;The Aristocracy in Twelfth-Century León and Castile&lt;/em&gt;. Cambridge University Press, 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annotation&lt;/strong&gt;: This secondary source provided information on the political and cultural environment that Marcabru was situated in, which was used to better understand &lt;em&gt;Pax in Nomine Domini&lt;/em&gt; as poetic propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Gaunt, Simon, Ruth Harvey, and Linda Paterson. &lt;em&gt;Marcabru: A Critical Edition&lt;/em&gt;. D.S. Brewer, 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annotation&lt;/strong&gt;: This source was used for clarification of Marcabru’s poetry in terms of place names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Goldin, Frederick. &lt;em&gt;Lyrics of the Troubadours and Trouvéres&lt;/em&gt;. Peter Smith, 1983.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annotation&lt;/strong&gt;: Goldin’s anthology specified the origins of Marcabru, his style of &lt;em&gt;Trobar Clus&lt;/em&gt;, and the lords that he may have been appealing to in his crusader poetry. This last piece of information was then used to determine the coloring arrangements of the mass of weapons at lower-left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Other major sources of inspiration for this project, in addition to Marcabru’s poem, include the Hereford Mapamundi, Matfré Ermengau’s &lt;em&gt;Chansonnier Occitan &lt;/em&gt;(c. 1301-1400), “&lt;a href=&quot;https://trobar.sites.stanford.edu/road-damascus&quot;&gt;The Road to Damascus&lt;/a&gt;” (a Performing Trobar project from a former student), a discussion with two Occitanian activists (8/17/2019), and a group visit to Toulouse’s Jacobins basilica.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A Troubadour&#039;s Guide to Wine Pairing</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/troubadours-guide-wine-pairing</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this project, I sought to combine my interested in wines from the Languedoc region with my passion for graphic design. After going on a number of amazing treks up mountains to visit castles and visit medieval sites, I noticed that wine always added a new element to the dining experience. Yet unlike traditional wine pairings that often only combine wine and food, I found that wine is also deeply connected to the broader context. Thus I wanted to examine the contextual questions to the overall wine experience—beginning with &quot;Where are you?&quot; and &quot;What are you doing?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, I wanted to put myself in the shoes of troubadours who might have been selecting a wine, and create different wine pathways. I consider this first half of the graphic to fit into the “Choose your adventure” flowchart category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second component contains more detailed information about the wines themselves. I wanted to include a spectrum that would be representative of the wines of the region, but by no means would attempt to encompass the vast variety of Languedoc wines. For each wine, the graphic includes the region in which it is produced, the types of grapes involved, and pairing notes for a specific vintage. While this infographic only scratches the surface of Languedoc wines, I hope that it sheds some insight into the very important wine choices that troubadours may have encountered along their travels and adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Rugby, Wine, and Occitan Culture</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/rugby-wine-and-occitan-culture</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the creative essay writing form, I looked to explore the relevancy of rugby throughout all of Occitania. Known as the sport of the people, as opposed to a sport of the bourgeois, rugby has remained a large part of this southern French culture. I talked with Frank Schisano, a rugby player who became a self-made wine maker, and explored how one could even make that seemingly incompatible transition, yet I found a few parallels by which the occupations are approached and sustained. Moreover, I was able to explore how deeply engrained some of the attitudes towards Northern Frenchman, and how they are proliferated even into something that may seem as trivial like sport. In order to keep this culture alive, the people of Occitania have to maintain that the language is active as opposed to constant revival through ancient texts. Despite the not so glamorous style and non-comparable pay to a sport like soccer, maybe kids still enroll in rugby academies as early as 9. This essay format was useful in displaying information from a first person source while being able to intermittently place in information from the other sources on rugby and wine, and subsequently, Occitan culture. Before typing this paper, vidas of trobadours were used to keep the free yet factual spirit of prose that was used at the time. The second hand sources dealing with rugby did well to keep the balance of having a dichotomy between the North and South while staying sensitive to the dialogue among the subcultures of the Occitan region.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Calendretta</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/calendretta</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;She knew that her system couldn’t have lasted forever, but it was almost crippled how quickly it ended up crumbling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occitania decided to mint new money. The Euro was now worthless and citizens were told to start community bonfires to burn their paper money and to leave to coins in the ashes. Anyone with contraband currency found in their home would be arrested for enemy sympathies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked through her bedroom window at the pyre below and thought of all of the Euros in her own home, the fact that she wouldn’t be able to help her neighbors any more since none of them had a job that would pay in cathars, the new currency. She looked at the flames jumping higher as people dumped in more Euros and caught glimpses of glinting coins at the bottom. Her eyes went in and out of focus as she stared at the flames, her resolve hardening to make her way accros the border to France. Her neighbors who were fellow immigrants had all already done so or decided that they would stay. She had only hesitated this long out of first disbelief, and, then, the memory of her father. Separating from the last place he had been alive felt like too drastic of an action, but as she stared into the flames and sparking embers below her window, she knew she would have to leave.&lt;br /&gt;
She went to bed with the flames dancing on her eyelids, a strange green relief against the black of her closed eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                                                                                                                   ✦✦✦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people around her were eerily calm as the arrows continued to fall. Several were hit and she watched the flames consume their white gowns, though they continued to stare serenely, all towards the same point. She watched in horror as the flames consumed the fabric and their hair. Then, in order to look at something else, anything else, she followed their gaze to the center of the crowd of white-gowned people. The bright figure was their again and she could feel a heat go through her. She took a step forward, but instead of becoming clearer, the figure seemed to blur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✦✦✦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She rubbed her eyes as she awoke, slowly remembering what she had resolved herself to do. She packed up everything she needed in a backpack, nestling her shortwave radio in a sweater to make sure it wouldn’t be damaged and she locked the door to her father’s home for the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bertran de Born “Be∙m platz lo gais temps de pascor” (45 in Goldin); Felip Hammel lecture on calendrettas; Fabrice Chambon lecture on Cathars at Montségur; Léglu “Vernacular poems and Inquisitors in Languedoc and Champagne, ca. 1242-1249”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Statement of Intent/Methodology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In thinking about “Occitania” I was very much interested in the various perspectives our lecturers had on the region. Some of them seemed to have an academic interest, others a preservationist interest; some seemed like separatists, others like it they almost wanted to return to the past. This got me thinking about what I perceived as micro-nationalism and the ways in which such thoughts have succeeded, partially succeeded, or failed in the past. I also thought about the type of mythos many of our lecturers seem to have created about their language and region, a mythos that valorises them, but which subsequently demonizes other parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am genuinely interested in preserving languages and cultures, but, often, I find that the actualization of this preservation leads to as many ills as gains. I decided to write a short story about some form of actualization of Occitania in this vein. I pulled from knowledge I have of secessionist movements such as the Biafran War of the 1960s and nationalist movements such as those of WWII in Europe. I wanted to explore what this fracturing and apparent choosing of camps would look like for an immigrant who has no stake in the outcome other than possibly losing the quality of life they had anticipated having in what was once France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to me how sometimes, in order to negate the loss of power oppressed groups have felt in the past, they then use newly-gained power to push down a completely separate group. To this end, I made comparisons between my main character (who is unnamed so that she may be from essentially anywhere but France or Occitania) and the Cathars at Montségur and ended the piece with a citation from Bertran de Born which exalts in the pain and suffering of others. I made a comparison between my main character’s boss going to a calendretta and the Dona Sancta in Léglu which has a young boy being saved from the Cathars – the Cathars in this case being the French. I chose the name of the piece to be “Calendretta” because I wanted to highlight the “immersion experience” of my main character in Occitan and the upheaval that a loss of something that seems so integral as language would bring.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>When in Occitania: A Reflection</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/when-occitania-reflection</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, in writing a creative, informal essay, I did not really adhere to any strict methodology. I mainly just wanted to relate my changing attitudes towards the seminar, while also providing a lightly analytical critique of some of our readings. In comparison with some of the more directly analytical projects my peers have created, I was at first a little wary of taking such a free-form approach—after all, I still wanted to demonstrate how much I had learned. But it is also important to take into account many different kinds of learning, and the intellectual and personal growth I’ve experienced during the seminar certainly deserved some attention. Above all, I wanted to express that academic content is best assimilated and appreciated when taken alongside personal reflection. This essay attempts to emphasize the close relationship between subjective impressions and sentiments to the ostensibly objective treatment of academic subjects—a relationship that is often blurry and poorly defined. In selecting two of my favorite readings from the course—the Taruskin and Léglu selections—I attempted to ground this relationship in my own opinions towards the performance of trobar and the preservation of Occitan culture. There is, I believe, a balance to be struck between the unemotional analysis of cultural topics and the naturally emotional responses they evoke, and it is only in striking this balance that students can gain a full appreciation for the intellectual ramifications of what they are learning. It is a difficult task, to be sure, but one worthy of dedicated effort.   “I don’t really get it.”Speaking to me through the phone last April, my mother echoed the sentiments of countless other friends and family members who simply could not understand why I was traveling to France. I had, of course, explained the objectives of the course—to learn about the troubadours, to more fully appreciate Occitan culture, and to recognize the complicated political and bureaucratic frameworks through which that culture is expressed—but they just could not fathom why I, an English major without connections to or extensive knowledge of anything French, would want to spend time there. Frustrated, I told my mom what I told everyone else:“It’s a six hundred dollar trip, the country will be beautiful, and I’ll get a lot of good food.”Naturally, this retort did not work out well with her, and she scoffed and hung up the phone shortly after reprimanding me for my so-called “immaturity.” I thought it was an excellent defense, however, and I left the interaction with an enhanced view of both myself and my fateful decision to enroll in the seminar.Still, as time passed, and the seminar date approached, I began to mull over my mother’s criticism. It was certainly fair—after all, for all intents and purposes I had no real reason to go to France, and perhaps I could instead use the time to get an early start on my summer research. The troubadours didn’t bear much significance in my life, and though I certainly respected their poetry and deeply appreciated their impact on subsequent artists and literary movements, I could just as easily have stayed around San Francisco and studied the Beat Poets. Even Occitania—the obscure, mysterious region made familiar to me via Wikipedia—no longer held the same fascinating appeal now that I knew I was actually going to explore it. The seed of doubt had been planted, and given my propensity to overthink things, flourished until I stepped on the plane to take me overseas.At that point, I had expected my anxieties to dissipate and be replaced by the thrill of international travel. Perhaps I’d seen too many Eurotrip comedy movies, but I thought that I’d then meet up with some fellow 20-year-old college kids and we’d immediately get wrapped up in a series of misadventures together—a fanciful hope that completely disregarded the fact I was actually enrolled in a class. Rather unsurprisingly, however, when I considered the academic implications of what I’d gotten myself into, a whole new slew of anxieties arose. What if these subjects were truly so unknown to me that learning about them would be more difficult than I had initially imagined? What if the fact I could not perform or competently analyze music would preclude me from contributing anything insightful during discussion with my esteemed peers? Or what about the fact I couldn’t speak French, or Occitan, or whatever it was they spoke where I was going?Jumping ahead to my first night at the Centre International de Sejour Narbonne, these questions seemed only to have become more relevant. It had been a long flight, I was tired, and “Now You See Me” had not been the rip-rollicking cinematic adventure my naive younger self had expected. So when Prof. Galvez kindly informed the group that Gerard had arranged a musical welcome for us, I could not help but let out a low and hopefully inaudible sigh of exasperation. Occitania, so far, had not proven intellectually exciting.It was that first trobar performance, however, that really showed me how much I stood to gain from the seminar--and how much I had to learn. Hearing the dramatic drone of the hurdy-gurdy (a phrase I never expected to write in my lifetime), the high staccato of the tympanum, and most of all the passionately inflected singing, I realized trobar was not, as I had so incorrectly presumed, a dead art. Nor was it hopelessly foreign to me--sure, the sound was far unlike what most young people typically listen to nowadays, but despite the fact that the lyrics were in Occitan and the hurdy-gurdy’s operation absolutely baffled me, I still felt a very real emotional response. I could tell the love songs apart from the dance tunes and the triumphant odes, and could somehow beat my foot to each one regardless of how strange they were to my modern tastes. So, buoyed by a delicious meal of meat and cheese, I realized this seminar deserved my full attention. I knew very little about the region’s history and rich cultural legacy, but I figured that if I only kept my eyes and ears open during our many outings and lectures, I was bound to learn something. And learn, I certainly did—about the Cathars, the various themes central to troubadour poetry, and southern France’s earnestly debated cultural future. Coming from a wholly American perspective, without much awareness for the complicated social, religious, and artistic movements that shaped the area, I was ignorant to the vast majority of what I was being taught. At first, I thought my lack of knowledge was purely a weakness, something that could not in any way serve my educational experience. As we continued to go through readings and explore new sites, however, I actually came to make use of my open mind as a position from which I could potentially form unique opinions.While I was reading through the Taruskin essay, for example, I was struck first of all by the author’s intense argumentation and meticulously reasoned viewpoint. His opinion that historians and musicologists can not, no matter their efforts, properly simulate the sound of music as it was originally performed both intrigued and even insulted me. I understand, of course, that it may indeed be impossible to perfectly reproduce musical compositions that have undergone considerable adaptation over several centuries, or about which historians lack the evidence necessary to make definitive conclusions, but out of respect for history itself I thought it would be crucial to at least attempt a historically correct reproduction. Granted, I am no renowned scholar, and considering my point of view does not draw upon dozens of reputable academic sources like that of Taruskin’s, maybe I am in no place to argue against him. But also considering the great passion with which modern troubadours celebrate the poetic and musical skills of their forebears, I think it’s wise to at least humor the thought that with a traditional performance we may be hearing something that has persisted, incredibly, over the centuries and whose purpose--to tell stories of love and sadness, war and peace--remains unchanged.This opinion comes mainly from my experiences listening to live troubadour performances, so I truly think there is something to be said solely about the way music makes one feel, without a scholarly lens to detract from its emotional impact. Nonetheless, on the other hand, I do still acknowledge that there is immense value in documenting and trying to uncover the context within which the artist creates his or her art. Catherine Léglu, in writing about the troubadours’ place within the Albigensian Crusade, provides one such important analysis. Contrary to popular belief, she argues, rather than being Cathar sympathizers who universally pledged themselves to a separate Occitan culture, some troubadours railed against or were indifferent to the Cathar faith. As Léglu herself states, “There is little to no evidence that any of the troubadours included in the chansonniers were either aware of or sympathetic towards Catharism” (Léglu, 119). In providing this contrarian viewpoint, even if unrelated to troubadour performance, Léglu demonstrates that without extensive, thorough examination of the cultural and historical contexts informing the troubadours’ music, the true impact and scope of their art can never be fully appreciated. From my standpoint, and the standpoint of other casually interested laymen, maybe it is enough to just say the music is beautiful and worth preserving--but to scholars like Léglu and Taruskin, there is more than the music that needs to be taken into account. Though I may not always find it exciting, I do respect their attention to detail, and without their scholarly passion complementing the troubadours’ artistry, the art would undoubtedly lose some of the admiration it very much deserves. Now, as the seminar is coming to a close, I’m proud to say that I have gained enough knowledge about Occitan culture and the troubadours that I can form these fundamental opinions. No longer do I appreciate France solely for its exceptional cuisine--though my appreciation has certainly grown over the past couple of weeks--but I’ve now become familiar with a fascinating culture and art that merit far more widespread recognition. Until that recognition can be achieved though, it comforts me that Gerard and his friends have at least kept Occitan traditions alive, and I hope that by expressing interest in them, my peers and I have done our small part to keep them alive too.      &lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The verse “Match Maker, Match Maker, make me a match” is ringing across the country.  Meanwhile, e-commerce dating sites are springing up rapidly, capitalizing on advances in social media and big data analysis.  An upcoming mobile dating application, Hinge, is examining changes to their business model to provide services and products ahead of the competition.  Hinge uses a unique algorithm by pairing friend-of-friends from Facebook through shared profession, education history, interests, and romantic history on the app.  Unlike other companies in the e-dating space, like Tinder, a dating app that puts a premium on objectifying other users based on a few pictures and a small blurb, Hinge offers its users a limited set of data-driven potential matches per day, to allow its users to carefully consider each match.Hinge is aware that Tinder is marketing toward a younger audience, users mostly in their 20s and 30s, utilizing geographic location to connect potential candidates.  Hinge takes it a step further by targeting young professionals by bringing in a sense of security, as a user’s next match will not be a “psychopath you read about on the Huffington Post last week, [because] after all, you know them.  Or at least a friend knows them.  Or a friend of a friend” (Reston).  Employing Facebook’s established friend networks, Hinge creates matches where a connection already exists. To increase revenue and maximize profitability, Hinge is launching into a new vertical, reviving a traditional dating technique that was popular in the 12th century.  Using Google’s newly invented cross-century communications system, Google Century Talk, [imaginary-has not yet been invented by Google, but I’m sure they’re working on this] contemporary users can communicate with their counterparts from centuries past.  At a recent strategic brainstorming session at Hinge, CEO Justin McLeod was apprised of this newly-developed technology, Google Century Talk, and is investigating the adoption and integration of a new Hinge troubadour platform, combining poetry and music in order to attract a powerful demographic in a new vertical. After a comprehensive analysis and research, the Hinge team has found that utilizing Google Century Talk to reach troubadours of the 12th century can add a new dimension while greatly advancing their dating app solutions.  NO other player in the e-dating sector has yet to integrate troubadour attributes into their offerings.  Hinge will be the first, gaining a competitive edge within their vertical.  Hinge selects troubadour poetry, instead of Petrarchan love sonnets, for its accessibility, its public performance, and its multimedia aspects.  Applying these aspects, the modern dating app seeks to integrate barrier-less, social, and multimedia attributes in their platforms. Deploying Google Century Talk, the executive team at Hinge makes contact with prominent troubadour Bernart de Ventadorn.  While his biography is uncertain, we know that Bernart de Ventadorn was “one of the most popular poets of his own day, judging from the numerous manuscripts of his songs, and from the many poets who allude to, or imitate, his work” (Goldin, 108).  Bernart de Ventadorn was able to play on the perspectives of his audience and sing of the highest forms of love.  Hinge believes that by integrating troubadour insight into their e-platform, Hinge can offer a powerful “new” model, attracting a larger customer base, a vertical ignored by their competition. In this project, I compare the mechanism and ideologies of the troubadours to 21st century dating apps.  Bernart de Ventadorn joins the Hinge team.  By hiring Bernart de Ventadorn as a consultant, Hinge learns about three important methodologies and ideologies, fin’amor, sincerity and authorship, and companho competition.  First, I explore fin’amor for Hinge because this dating app, unlike the solution offered by their competitor Tinder, which I characterize as fals’amor, is a refined, relationship-building app.  Through the application of themes on the codes of love from Roland Barthes and Linda Patterson, the objective for both the troubadours and Hinge, is to offer fin’amor to its target audience.  Like the audience in the courtly environment, the users on this dating app are selective, already present within the codes of matchmaking. Second, I examine sincerity and authorship of the troubadours and allow the Hinge team to apply these concepts.  Like the troubadours&amp;#039; innovations of new patterns of verbal sound, Hinge’s premium users can also apply  “combination and recombination [to serve] as a powerful stimulus” (Switten).  Switten teaches us that there is no one author, that users can also be “authors.”  Through Taruskin, I explore true authenticity and historical verisimilitude, allowing our users to pay tribute to the “authentic” artist and to permit modern interpretations.  I also reference Barthes to explain that the authentic performance of both the troubadour and the app user should avoid the “ideal,” but rather focus on the “process.”  The Hinge executive team can bring authenticity to their new platform. Third, I investigate the competition aspect of troubadour lyrics by reviewing Gaunt in “Poetry of Exclusion.”  While the troubadour not only professed love objectively, there often existed another layer, a secondary purpose, where the troubadour was exhibiting his women in the public domain.  Bringing this same concept to the e-dating app, adding this “option” to make the user’s lyrics public, acts as a deliberate display of the user’s abilities and accomplishments.Rereading the troubadour lyrics from the 21st century lens allows Hinge to exploit the interactive dimension, improving contemporary dating techniques.  Below is a transcript of the e-exchange and performance, between the Hinge team and Bernart de Ventadorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-course field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Course:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;DLCL 121: Performing the Middle Ages (FRENCH 151)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-project-type field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Project type:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/project-type/creative-work&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;creative work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

He fortified Navarre to such an extent that it was never defeated during all of Sancho’s reign. This left his four children richly endowed and allowed them to become enticing prospects for other kingdoms. Berengaria was a kind, wise and talented girl who learned to love Navarre and its culture from her father. The troubadours were at the time a prominent fixture within the Navarra culture.  Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was the queen dowager of England was hoping to marry her son Richard the Lionheart to an educated and cultured young woman like herself, began marriage negotiations and asked that some of the kingdom’s acclaimed troubadours accompany her to Sicily, where the marriage was to be officiated. History would mark Berengaria as the only English Queen who never set foot on English soil, and as the queen who brought the celebrated troubadour culture to England. Richard the Lionheart, who only returned to England for 6 months out of his reign, died leaving his widow behind in Navarre. Berengaria then captured the heart of a certain Martin Codax, a Galician medieval joglar and a troubadour from Vigo, which can be found in what is now known as present day Spain. Martin was in love with Berengaria, knowing that marriage with this queen dowager was certainly an impossibility. He wrote seven cantigas d&amp;#039;amigo which appear in the Galician-Portuguese songbooks today. It is said throughout medieval folklore that Martin had gone to celebrate the birthday of Peter the II, the current King of Aragon and the Count of Barcelona, when news of the massacre reached the kingdom. The massacre at Beziers had accomplished what it was intended to do and placed fear in the hearts of all who heard the news. The troubadours who had arrived at the palace for the king’s celebration were ordered to remain there and to stay for their own safety.  It was during this time Berengaria wrote this song for her own beloved Martin. Legend has it that Martin Codax volunteered for the crusades and died just before he passed through Navarre to get through France, on his way to see Berengaria.    Crees que cantan Pajaros  En los Cortes De Aragon? Cantan en tus castillos?  Aqui se quedan sin cancion,  La primavera me ha abandonado Invierno me ha abrazado Trobador, por favor, vuelva a mi.   Rezo para un hombre La oracion de poder “Santificado sea tu nombre” Tu rezas a la virgen mujer Antes de dias de promesa y amor Invierno era infierno, puro calor Trobador, mi amor, vuelva a mi…   En tu campo florecido, La sinsonte trae cancion Se burla de mi destino  En mi maldita dirección Quién tambien vuela, a nuestro camino?  Vuelan de Beziers, markando su destino Trobador, por favor, floritura aquí…  Te pido mi Virgin Santa Y Pedro El Segundo Mira esta Guerra Santa y salve nuestro mundo Ser fiel, por favor, no deben traicionar Los conquistadores afuera, esperan triunfar Trobador mi amor, ven por mi…  Esperan afuera mis muros Mis muros del Castillo Sus colores tan oscuros frente nuestro Amarillo A Aquitania ha traído la cultura trobador Le quiero para mí, muero un pecador Trobador, por favor, vuelve a mi…            English Version  Do the birds sing Within the courts of Aragon? Do they sing within your castles? Yet here their song is gone Springtime has abandoned me, Winter in its place Troubadour, please return it to me…  I pray for just one man Behold the power of the prayer “Hallowed be thy name”  Yet you pray for the Virgin Saint Before, the days were full of promise and full of love, Winter was aflame, heat is all it consisted of, Troubadour, my love, return to me,   All within your flourished fields  The mockingbird mocks your intention He mocks with the way he yields Away from my damned direction  Do you know who else mocks us, and brings us their song? Straight from Beziers, where they rode all night long Troubadour, come, flourish with me   I beg of you the Virgin Mary,  Peter the Second as well To see this unjust Holy War And save our world from hell Stay faithful, please, do not betray The conquistadores, outside they stay Troubadour, my love, come for me   They wait outside my castle walls My walls are high, they wait Our yellow crosses hold them off Their colors are dark and death I brought the troubadour culture with my dowry, in to the outside lands The sinner I am ask for them back, these are my demands Troubadour please, come back to me.       VIDAS  Berengaria was a young princess who lived in the kingdom of Navarre. Berengaria was married to King Richard for only 8 years, when he died during the crusades. Berengaria then fell in love with a Spanish troubadour named Martin Codex, whom she communicated with using many different birds.  Martin had gone to celebrate the birthday of Peter the II in July, the year of 1209. Both had heard about the massacre at Beziers. Shortly after communication stopped, Berengaria feared the worst and collected every single bird she saw. She was especially fond of trapping Mocking birds, sometimes even cooking them for dinner if they did not sing for her.  Berengaria retired to an Abbey in Le Mans where she became a nun and died in the Abbey shortly thereafter…&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>From Domna to Trobaritz: Lessons from Medieval Poets to a Modern Day Poet</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/domna-trobaritz-lessons-medieval-poets-modern-day-poet</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement of intent: Using themes, forms, and functions of trobaritz works. How are our writings shaped by medieval thinkers and creators? What can we learn from these motifs? &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
I have traveled this land over here/&lt;br /&gt;
From Carcassonne out to Beziers/&lt;br /&gt;
And what I’ve seen will inspire you, dear/&lt;br /&gt;
To become of the world a great seer/&lt;br /&gt;
You will find me as a land unconquered/&lt;br /&gt;
Come with me and we shall make it clear/&lt;br /&gt;
It is you who arouses a word/&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
My beauty glows outward, draws you in/&lt;br /&gt;
We are magnets and together spin/&lt;br /&gt;
My voice carries far and strikes your skin/&lt;br /&gt;
It is strong with power, not sickly thin/&lt;br /&gt;
Listen close to what it is I say/&lt;br /&gt;
It is the truth and where I begin/&lt;br /&gt;
Watch my whole world be built in a day/&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Do not give me reason to lament/&lt;br /&gt;
Chase no others, I will be content/&lt;br /&gt;
Cross me and thus begins your descent/&lt;br /&gt;
Think of all the time that I have spent/&lt;br /&gt;
Crafting this verse so heartfelt and true/&lt;br /&gt;
My hounds will always know of your scent/&lt;br /&gt;
I am to be respected by you/&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
I will love you more than anyone/&lt;br /&gt;
Together will our hearts go and run/&lt;br /&gt;
We will share all that we have begun/&lt;br /&gt;
Our passion will be rivaled by none/&lt;br /&gt;
Are you prepared to walk with me now?/&lt;br /&gt;
Side by side until we reach the sun/&lt;br /&gt;
Everything done with sweat on our brow/&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Fair love, this I will promise to you/&lt;br /&gt;
And I expect the same to be true/&lt;br /&gt;
From the very moment that we choose/&lt;br /&gt;
To search in each other through and through/&lt;br /&gt;
One and another create a pair/&lt;br /&gt;
We must not forget or misconstrue/&lt;br /&gt;
Our place with each other, what we share/&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Remember my words, don’t pass them through/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of both our spirits I am aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-course field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Course:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Songs of Love and War: Gender, Crusade, Politics (Winter 2014)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/poetry&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-project-type field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Project type:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/project-type/creative-work&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;creative work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
