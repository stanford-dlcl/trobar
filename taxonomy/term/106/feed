 <title>Horse symbolism in troubadour poetry (podcast)</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement of intent: This podcast explores the symbolism of the horse in troubadour poems, ancient sculptures, and modern art forms.&lt;br /&gt;
In this first podcast, we looked into the symbolism of the horse in various troubadours’ poetry by referencing ancient Roman and Greek art, bestiaries, modern sculptures, and modern music interpretations of troubadour lyrics. In Roman and Greek art exhibited in the archaeology museum in Narbonne, horses are almost always depicted as soldiers’ companions in war (see figure 1 for Roman sculpture of war chariot, and figure 2 for modern representation of Greek warrior horse), and ancient Roman cities are designed specifically with the frequent use of horses and chariots in mind. Ancient bestiaries, such as the one written by Isidore of Seville in 7th century CE, indicate that horses are the only animals that are naturally drawn towards war and respond to war trumpets and battle cries, explaining why many troubadours use horses to describe the act of going into battle and of doing work. Bertran de Born, a troubadour whose love of war is widely known, often uses the imagery of the horse to validate the valiance of a lord or the violence of a battle. Guillaume IX, in his poem Farai un vers de dreyt nien (Goldin, 24), writes a poem about riding his horse while doing nothing – an act of defiance against his duties as a lord – and uses his horse to simultaneously represent both duty and his rejection of duty. Because of their association with lords and knights, horses were also connected with images of chivalry and loyalty. According to the Pliny the Elder in his bestiary from 1st century CE, horses are extremely faithful to their masters and are known to grieve when their masters die. This ties in effortlessly with the idea of paratge, a concept that encompasses honor, courtesy, nobility, and gentility often explored in troubadour poetries.&lt;br /&gt;
While horses represent war and nobility to some troubadours, others often used them as a metaphor for women or sexual conquests. The act of riding a horse has obvious similarities to the act of sexual intercourse, as exploited in Guillaume IX’s poem Companho, faray un vers…convinen, in which he writes about two women as “two good and noble horses for [his] saddle” (Goldin, 21). Marcabru, in his poem L’autrier jost’una sebissa, evokes a horse-riding imagery when he writes about a knight seducing a shepherd girl by saying that she “would be twice as beautiful / if once [he] saw [her] / underneath and [him] on top” (Goldin, 75). An interesting point can be noted that while troubadour poetry hails fin’amor and places the domna on a perfect pedestal, troubadours still prize the imagery of riding a woman and having the woman physically, and perhaps also metaphorically, beneath them.&lt;br /&gt;
All three symbols of the horse presented above can be combined with the idea of horse as a representation of rhythm. Firstly, horses respond to the rhythm of battle cries, which explains their symbolism of war and power. Moreover, horses’ hoof beats carry a characteristic, ordered rhythm that corresponds well with the order of chivalrous society and the ordered relationships between lords and their vassals. Finally, the rhythmic vertical bounces while riding a horse are reflected in the rhythmic movement of sexual intercourse, transforming the act of horse riding into a distinctive euphemism for sexual escapades, and horses into a metaphor for sexual prowess and conquests. This focus on rhythm in relation to horses is highlighted in Gerard Zuchetto’s interpretation of Guillaume IX’s poem Farai un vers de dreyt nien, referenced earlier, in which the rhythmic tapping of the drum and the recitation of the poem mimic the ordered hoof beats of horses on the road. Zuchetto’s interpretation seamlessly ties together all the symbolisms that the horse carries in various forms of art and literature during the troubadour period.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Bird symbolism in troubadour poetry (podcast)</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/bird-symbolism-troubadour-poetry-podcast</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement of intent: This second podcast explores the symbolism of the bird in ancient and modern poems and music.&lt;br /&gt;
In this second podcast, we investigated the symbol of the bird in troubadour poetry and music, as well as crusade songs and modern Occitan poetry. As with many traditional troubadour poems, this podcast began with a natureingang, featuring a reflection on the surrounding natural scenery that inspires a poet to begin his or her song. Birds, in these traditional natureingang openings, represent spring and happiness and can remind the poets of either delight or sorrow in their lives. Many times the poet continues on to represent the bird as his or her own voice, and beseeches the bird to sing and deliver the poet’s message as best as it can. Because many of troubadours’ poems were performed by jongleurs, birds can also represent the jongleur or the poet’s message itself, as seen in Peire d’Alvernhe’s poem Ben a ten gut dreg viatge, where he says to his bird, “you will go for me / to his dwelling, when the morning comes, / and tell him with an honest tongue / how I wait on his desire” (Goldin, 169).&lt;br /&gt;
The song of the bird is alluded to in both troubadour lyrics as well as melodies. Some poems incorporate actual musical terms into the lyrics, such as melismas mentioned in Giraut de Bornelh’s poem Can lo glatz el frechs e la neus (Goldin, 190) and modulations mentioned in Jaufré Rudel’s poem Quan lo rius de la fontana (Goldin, 102). Others mimic birds’ chirping in their musical performances, using high trills and ornaments to recreate the songs of birds. An example of this is Gerard Zuchetto and the Troubadour Art Ensemble’s rendition of Rudel’s Quan lo rius, in which the flute is heavily utilized to imitate the nightingale’s song. Interestingly, ancient bestiaries, such as one by Pliny the Elder written in 1st century CE, specifically highlight the fact that nightingales are the only bird known to use “all of the arts that human science has developed in the mechanism of the flute.”&lt;br /&gt;
While many troubadours talk about sending individual birds as messengers to their lovers in afar, many art forms in the same period (see figures 1 and 2) depict birds more as a flock or as part of the surrounding nature and less as unique or individual figures. This mismatch between how troubadours portray birds and how birds are portrayed in popular culture at the time carries an interesting parallel with what troubadours attempt to achieve with their poetry. Instead of being considered as part of a flock, troubadours hope to use their song to differentiate themselves from all the members of their troupe, including the other courtly enemies and false lovers who surround the troubadours and their domnas.&lt;br /&gt;
Apart from their role in lovers’ communications, birds, by virtue of their ability to fly over physical barriers and distances, have come to symbolize hope and resistance. In crusade poetry, such as Jaufre Rudel’s Lanquan li horn son lonc en may (Goldin, 104), birds remind the poet of his love far away, a love whose distance from him can only be overcome by the birds’ ability to fly and overcome the physical obstacles between them. Similarly, in the 1907 winemakers’ resistance song Se Canta, which describes a little bird singing a tune to its lover far away, the bird represents hope and resistance able to fly over mountains and meadows to get to its final goal and destination.&lt;br /&gt;
In a more modern example, the bird takes on a spiritual representation of ascension in the contemporary usage of an ascending bird as a symbol of Catharism. Luc Séverac, the sculptor of a stone statue in Minerve that has come to represent Cathar resistance (see figure 3), deliberately carved the bird facing up, instead of facing down as is commonly used to depict the Holy Spirit, and chose a circle to enclose the figure of the bird to create a monument to harmony, instead of a monument to the dead. This spiritual symbolism of the bird is reflected in Matfre Ermengau’s edition of Breviari d’amor, in which the earth is depicted as being in the center of the universe, and surrounded by the classical elements of water, air and fire. Positions further away from the earth and closer to the outer spheres of the universe are seen as purer and more spiritual – the bird, because it transverses through the air, is therefore more spiritual and pure than humans on the earth, giving a historical perspective on why the bird was used as a spiritual representation of hope and ascension.&lt;br /&gt;
Poets have continued this spiritual symbolism of the bird into modern times. For example, according to Franc Bardou, modern Occitan poets have employed the bird to depict their spirits or their subconscious. A more general focus on the idea of ascension is also evident in many modern Occitan poems, such as ones by Miquel Decor, who attempts to ascend using his poetry and his words and spiral towards a more spiritual and heavenly state.&lt;/p&gt;
