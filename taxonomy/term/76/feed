 <title>Rugby, Wine, and Occitan Culture</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/rugby-wine-and-occitan-culture</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the creative essay writing form, I looked to explore the relevancy of rugby throughout all of Occitania. Known as the sport of the people, as opposed to a sport of the bourgeois, rugby has remained a large part of this southern French culture. I talked with Frank Schisano, a rugby player who became a self-made wine maker, and explored how one could even make that seemingly incompatible transition, yet I found a few parallels by which the occupations are approached and sustained. Moreover, I was able to explore how deeply engrained some of the attitudes towards Northern Frenchman, and how they are proliferated even into something that may seem as trivial like sport. In order to keep this culture alive, the people of Occitania have to maintain that the language is active as opposed to constant revival through ancient texts. Despite the not so glamorous style and non-comparable pay to a sport like soccer, maybe kids still enroll in rugby academies as early as 9. This essay format was useful in displaying information from a first person source while being able to intermittently place in information from the other sources on rugby and wine, and subsequently, Occitan culture. Before typing this paper, vidas of trobadours were used to keep the free yet factual spirit of prose that was used at the time. The second hand sources dealing with rugby did well to keep the balance of having a dichotomy between the North and South while staying sensitive to the dialogue among the subcultures of the Occitan region.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Feminism in Trobar Poetry vs. in Disney Princess Films</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/feminism-trobar-poetry-vs-disney-princess-films</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of my presentation is to identify characteristics of troubadour and trobaritz poetry that could have evolved or been integrated into Disney princess culture.  Some of the characteristics present in trobaritz poetry include physical and sexual attraction and fina amor, or courtly love.  There exists an ongoing debate over whether Disney princess culture is progressive in the feminist eye, but it is not conclusive by any means because evidence used to support both sides is largely anecdotal and subjective.  Examining gender dynamics of courtly love through historical lens provides the perspective of a society that existed centuries ago.  Analyzing trobar poetry and Disney princess films is a fruitful comparison because they both focus primarily on the subject of courtly love.  Although Disney princess films have their historical roots in the Medieval Age, trobar literature covers topics relevant to people and societies regardless of the time period.  Such topics involve sentiments: love, anguish, hope, despair, and longing, which pertain to all human beings.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two poems by Raimbaut de Vaqueira and La Comtessa de Dia illustrate that there is no consensus amongst troubadour and trobaritz poetry.  Additionally, scholars in trobar literature disagree with how progressive these 12th century works were.  Concepts illustrated in these two poems, such as fina amor and a focus on physical appearance are also observed in Disney’s princess films.  The intent of juxtaposing works of art from time periods centuries apart is to demonstrate how certain sentiments are universal, and that the works of the troubadours and trobaritz still are relevant to contemporary society.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-course field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Course:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;OSPGEN 77: The Other France: Troubadours and the Politics of Cultural Heritage&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/essay&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-project-type field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Project type:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/project-type/modern-comparison&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;modern comparison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>When in Occitania: A Reflection</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/when-occitania-reflection</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, in writing a creative, informal essay, I did not really adhere to any strict methodology. I mainly just wanted to relate my changing attitudes towards the seminar, while also providing a lightly analytical critique of some of our readings. In comparison with some of the more directly analytical projects my peers have created, I was at first a little wary of taking such a free-form approach—after all, I still wanted to demonstrate how much I had learned. But it is also important to take into account many different kinds of learning, and the intellectual and personal growth I’ve experienced during the seminar certainly deserved some attention. Above all, I wanted to express that academic content is best assimilated and appreciated when taken alongside personal reflection. This essay attempts to emphasize the close relationship between subjective impressions and sentiments to the ostensibly objective treatment of academic subjects—a relationship that is often blurry and poorly defined. In selecting two of my favorite readings from the course—the Taruskin and Léglu selections—I attempted to ground this relationship in my own opinions towards the performance of trobar and the preservation of Occitan culture. There is, I believe, a balance to be struck between the unemotional analysis of cultural topics and the naturally emotional responses they evoke, and it is only in striking this balance that students can gain a full appreciation for the intellectual ramifications of what they are learning. It is a difficult task, to be sure, but one worthy of dedicated effort.   “I don’t really get it.”Speaking to me through the phone last April, my mother echoed the sentiments of countless other friends and family members who simply could not understand why I was traveling to France. I had, of course, explained the objectives of the course—to learn about the troubadours, to more fully appreciate Occitan culture, and to recognize the complicated political and bureaucratic frameworks through which that culture is expressed—but they just could not fathom why I, an English major without connections to or extensive knowledge of anything French, would want to spend time there. Frustrated, I told my mom what I told everyone else:“It’s a six hundred dollar trip, the country will be beautiful, and I’ll get a lot of good food.”Naturally, this retort did not work out well with her, and she scoffed and hung up the phone shortly after reprimanding me for my so-called “immaturity.” I thought it was an excellent defense, however, and I left the interaction with an enhanced view of both myself and my fateful decision to enroll in the seminar.Still, as time passed, and the seminar date approached, I began to mull over my mother’s criticism. It was certainly fair—after all, for all intents and purposes I had no real reason to go to France, and perhaps I could instead use the time to get an early start on my summer research. The troubadours didn’t bear much significance in my life, and though I certainly respected their poetry and deeply appreciated their impact on subsequent artists and literary movements, I could just as easily have stayed around San Francisco and studied the Beat Poets. Even Occitania—the obscure, mysterious region made familiar to me via Wikipedia—no longer held the same fascinating appeal now that I knew I was actually going to explore it. The seed of doubt had been planted, and given my propensity to overthink things, flourished until I stepped on the plane to take me overseas.At that point, I had expected my anxieties to dissipate and be replaced by the thrill of international travel. Perhaps I’d seen too many Eurotrip comedy movies, but I thought that I’d then meet up with some fellow 20-year-old college kids and we’d immediately get wrapped up in a series of misadventures together—a fanciful hope that completely disregarded the fact I was actually enrolled in a class. Rather unsurprisingly, however, when I considered the academic implications of what I’d gotten myself into, a whole new slew of anxieties arose. What if these subjects were truly so unknown to me that learning about them would be more difficult than I had initially imagined? What if the fact I could not perform or competently analyze music would preclude me from contributing anything insightful during discussion with my esteemed peers? Or what about the fact I couldn’t speak French, or Occitan, or whatever it was they spoke where I was going?Jumping ahead to my first night at the Centre International de Sejour Narbonne, these questions seemed only to have become more relevant. It had been a long flight, I was tired, and “Now You See Me” had not been the rip-rollicking cinematic adventure my naive younger self had expected. So when Prof. Galvez kindly informed the group that Gerard had arranged a musical welcome for us, I could not help but let out a low and hopefully inaudible sigh of exasperation. Occitania, so far, had not proven intellectually exciting.It was that first trobar performance, however, that really showed me how much I stood to gain from the seminar--and how much I had to learn. Hearing the dramatic drone of the hurdy-gurdy (a phrase I never expected to write in my lifetime), the high staccato of the tympanum, and most of all the passionately inflected singing, I realized trobar was not, as I had so incorrectly presumed, a dead art. Nor was it hopelessly foreign to me--sure, the sound was far unlike what most young people typically listen to nowadays, but despite the fact that the lyrics were in Occitan and the hurdy-gurdy’s operation absolutely baffled me, I still felt a very real emotional response. I could tell the love songs apart from the dance tunes and the triumphant odes, and could somehow beat my foot to each one regardless of how strange they were to my modern tastes. So, buoyed by a delicious meal of meat and cheese, I realized this seminar deserved my full attention. I knew very little about the region’s history and rich cultural legacy, but I figured that if I only kept my eyes and ears open during our many outings and lectures, I was bound to learn something. And learn, I certainly did—about the Cathars, the various themes central to troubadour poetry, and southern France’s earnestly debated cultural future. Coming from a wholly American perspective, without much awareness for the complicated social, religious, and artistic movements that shaped the area, I was ignorant to the vast majority of what I was being taught. At first, I thought my lack of knowledge was purely a weakness, something that could not in any way serve my educational experience. As we continued to go through readings and explore new sites, however, I actually came to make use of my open mind as a position from which I could potentially form unique opinions.While I was reading through the Taruskin essay, for example, I was struck first of all by the author’s intense argumentation and meticulously reasoned viewpoint. His opinion that historians and musicologists can not, no matter their efforts, properly simulate the sound of music as it was originally performed both intrigued and even insulted me. I understand, of course, that it may indeed be impossible to perfectly reproduce musical compositions that have undergone considerable adaptation over several centuries, or about which historians lack the evidence necessary to make definitive conclusions, but out of respect for history itself I thought it would be crucial to at least attempt a historically correct reproduction. Granted, I am no renowned scholar, and considering my point of view does not draw upon dozens of reputable academic sources like that of Taruskin’s, maybe I am in no place to argue against him. But also considering the great passion with which modern troubadours celebrate the poetic and musical skills of their forebears, I think it’s wise to at least humor the thought that with a traditional performance we may be hearing something that has persisted, incredibly, over the centuries and whose purpose--to tell stories of love and sadness, war and peace--remains unchanged.This opinion comes mainly from my experiences listening to live troubadour performances, so I truly think there is something to be said solely about the way music makes one feel, without a scholarly lens to detract from its emotional impact. Nonetheless, on the other hand, I do still acknowledge that there is immense value in documenting and trying to uncover the context within which the artist creates his or her art. Catherine Léglu, in writing about the troubadours’ place within the Albigensian Crusade, provides one such important analysis. Contrary to popular belief, she argues, rather than being Cathar sympathizers who universally pledged themselves to a separate Occitan culture, some troubadours railed against or were indifferent to the Cathar faith. As Léglu herself states, “There is little to no evidence that any of the troubadours included in the chansonniers were either aware of or sympathetic towards Catharism” (Léglu, 119). In providing this contrarian viewpoint, even if unrelated to troubadour performance, Léglu demonstrates that without extensive, thorough examination of the cultural and historical contexts informing the troubadours’ music, the true impact and scope of their art can never be fully appreciated. From my standpoint, and the standpoint of other casually interested laymen, maybe it is enough to just say the music is beautiful and worth preserving--but to scholars like Léglu and Taruskin, there is more than the music that needs to be taken into account. Though I may not always find it exciting, I do respect their attention to detail, and without their scholarly passion complementing the troubadours’ artistry, the art would undoubtedly lose some of the admiration it very much deserves. Now, as the seminar is coming to a close, I’m proud to say that I have gained enough knowledge about Occitan culture and the troubadours that I can form these fundamental opinions. No longer do I appreciate France solely for its exceptional cuisine--though my appreciation has certainly grown over the past couple of weeks--but I’ve now become familiar with a fascinating culture and art that merit far more widespread recognition. Until that recognition can be achieved though, it comforts me that Gerard and his friends have at least kept Occitan traditions alive, and I hope that by expressing interest in them, my peers and I have done our small part to keep them alive too.      &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>La Vergonha and the Future of Occitan Language</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/la-vergonha-and-future-occitan-language</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my project, I wanted to explore how exactly the Occitan language experienced its decline since the time of the troubadours up until modern times. I looked at several secondary sources that examined the place of Occitan in France throughout history, and in addition, I looked at legislature, particularly the French Constitution to find France’s stance on language in the country. I started out by looking into the current status of Occitan in France alongside the presence of Occitan in medieval Europe after the time of the troubadours and Cathars. I then discovered France’s complicated history with language policies, and then furthermore, the attempted, systematic suppression of regional languages during the 19th and 20th centuries. Thus, I focused my project on the complexities of France’s language policies and its attempted linguicide of Occitan and the other regional languages of France. I started off with the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts in 1539 which marked the beginning of the long decline, and I ended with modern day politics, including the political parties in France and also the European Union. Throughout its history, France has tried many times to implement a monolingual nation, and the most effective implementation came in the latter half of the 19th century. Called “La Vergonha” by native speakers, the time period in France was marked by shaming of Occitan speakers, exclusion in the media, and even parents refusing to pass on the language to their children. From 1860 to the present day, the percentage of native speakers dropped from 39% to less than 10%, and the number continues to dwindle today. Despite this however, support from the Council of Europe, the Socialist Party, and popular opinion has led to a revival. The question remains however if this revival comes too little, too late. With less than half a million natives and the encroaching influence of globalization, it is possible that Occitan disappears in another century or two. There has been success in language revitalization across the world, but only time will tell if Occitan is lost to English and French or if it will survive as a major force in southern France.  &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Looking through the eyes of Bertran de Born</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/looking-through-eyes-bertran-de-born</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal Springtime                                                                                           Bertran de Born&amp;#039;s Springtime&lt;br /&gt;
                       &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Bertran de Born: &lt;br /&gt;
was a minor nobleman, though he had his own castle that he used for protection during war times&lt;br /&gt;
fortunes depended on his success in war&lt;br /&gt;
was a spokesman for the noble mercenaries&lt;br /&gt;
disliked times of peace because he would usually be poor&lt;br /&gt;
loved war since mercenaries paid him during this time&lt;br /&gt;
utilized the &amp;#039;sirventes&amp;#039; genre mostly to satirize the ‘canso’&lt;br /&gt;
was crusader as well as a troubadour&lt;br /&gt;
had an interesting view of the youthful qualities (&amp;#039;joves&amp;#039; in occitan) of a man that he showed in his writing style&lt;br /&gt;
In Bel m&amp;#039;es, quan vei chamjar lo senhoratge, Born states &amp;quot;Joves es hom que lo sieu ben engatge&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Vielhs es rics hom, quan re no met en gatge&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
English: &amp;quot;A man is young when he stakes everything he has&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A man is old when he won&amp;#039;t risk a thing&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
In this example, Born is showing his audience that he ties youthfulness with risk and spontaneity without considering the consequences&lt;br /&gt;
attempted to use crusade lyric to reconcile spiritual and material life&lt;br /&gt;
celebrated the ritual beauty and the horror of medieval warfare &lt;br /&gt;
“for war made a man and made money” &lt;br /&gt;
Be.m platz lo gais temps de Pascor:&lt;br /&gt;
Bertran de Born had an interesting Natureingang that switches from a general springtime setting to the setting of war during the spring&lt;br /&gt;
Occitan: &amp;quot;Be.m platz lo gais temps de pascor ... quan vei per champanha renjatz chavaliers e chavals armatz&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
English: “I love the joyful time of Easter … when I see ranged along the field knights and horses armed for war”&lt;br /&gt;
Bertran de Born loved displays of physical strength especially in war&lt;br /&gt;
“I am pleased by a lord when he is first in attack”&lt;br /&gt;
Bertran de Born finds no pleasure in peace since fighting was profitable for him&lt;br /&gt;
“it pleases me when I see strong castles besieged”&lt;br /&gt;
Bertran de Born was pleased because he was about to make a good amount money&lt;br /&gt;
Intentio Recta Argument:&lt;br /&gt;
intentio recta defined in The Voice of the Unrepentant Crusader: “Aler M’estuet” by The Chântelain D’arras by Marisa Galvez&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In taking up the cross, the preacher Bernard of Clairvaux said that crusaders should have a pure conscience (pura conscientia) and &amp;quot;right intention&amp;quot; (intentio recta). Together with other clerical apologists of the Second Crusade such as Peter the Venerable and Ralph Niger, who subscribed to the pilgrimage tradition, Bernard emphasized that the physical imitatio Christi was of little value unless it was accompanied by an internal, spiritual imitatio.  This imitatio took the form of a moral regeneration that was a mark of true repentance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bertran de Born wrote crusade lyric to help influence noblemen to go on crusade, however, by his background and character, we know that making money was his main goal for any war.&lt;br /&gt;
It is known that Bertran de Born loved his material possessions as well.&lt;br /&gt;
In his lyric, &amp;quot;Miei sirventes vuolh far de.ls reis amdos&amp;quot;, Bertran de Born discusses the two kings who want to go to war and are willing to pay heavily for soldiers.&lt;br /&gt;
He continues to talk about the war, saying &amp;quot;lo perdr&amp;#039; er grans e.l guazanhs er sobriers&amp;quot;, meaning &amp;quot;the loss will be great [referring to the dead], but the winnings will be greater&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
In his tornada he says, &amp;quot;mas si.l reis ve, ieu ai en dieu fianza qu&amp;#039;ieu serai per quartiers; e si sui vius, er mi grans benananza, e si ieu muoir, er mu grans deliuriers&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
English: &amp;quot;If the King comes, I put my faith in God I shall be alive or in pieces. And if I am alive, it will be great luck, and if I am dead, a great deliverance&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
From the Galvez&amp;#039;s excerpt, we see that physical imitatio Christi is of little value unless accompanied by spiritual imitatio where imitatio took the form of moral regeneration which marked true repentance, both of these was essential in determining if one truly had intentio recta&lt;br /&gt;
Bertran de Born introduces God in this tornada, saying he will put all his faith in God, he finalizes it by saying if he was dead it would be a great deliverance.&lt;br /&gt;
Born here is showing a little physical imitatio by personifying God but he is also showing that he yet to reach spiritual imitatio.&lt;br /&gt;
All through the lyric he shows his joy in war and the money he will make from it, but he knows the only way he can reach true deliverance with God is if he was to end up dead&lt;br /&gt;
Since Born only proposes him reaching spiritual imitatio in the afterlife, we can assume that he did not have &amp;#039;intentio recta&amp;#039; at least while living on Earth&lt;br /&gt;
Also by his background, I believe Bertran de Born did not have ‘intentio recta’ with regard with crusade since one can argue that while he was on crusade, his intentions were more to pillage, besiege castles, and gain money and possessions instead of to save the holy land&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Museum Administration in Languedoc Roussillon</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/museum-administration-languedoc-roussillon</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are trying to learn about medieval Occitania in Languedoc-Roussillon, a visitor will be drawn to the old castles, cultural institutions like Cirdoc or the various mediatheques, but also to the various regional museums. As an American with some experience in museum programs and management, a lot of the museums we visited struck me as very similar. For our purpose, I will focus on the Centre du Sculpture Romane in Cabestany, the Centre du Chateau des Lastours, and the Musee Archeologique du Narbonne.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
All of these museums had commonalities in display and message which cannot be explained simply by proximity. They were all purpose built museum spaces, either constructed completely from scratch at Cabestany and Lastours, or built into the Palais des Archeveques but with complete remodeled interior decorating. They had strong natural colored wall schemes, either of blond or dark stained wood panels, or earth tones and glass walls at Lastours.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Architecture aside, they seemed to be organized along a similar pedagogical philosophy. There were grottoes or rooms which visitors could walk under or glance at, but never into, unlike at the municipal museum at Castello d’Empuries across the border in Catalonia, which made the physical space of the comital palace an integral part of the exhibition. Miniaturized models of landscapes and and building complexes featured heavily alongside identically designed frosted glass explanatory panels. In the gift shops, they sold the same children’s books about medieval Occitania, bilingual French and Catalan vocabularies, and cookbooks. The inventories could easily have been copied from one another.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
What was the root of this similarity? From my experience in industry, such stylistic consistency is generally representative of a single designer, or multiple designers subscribing to similar philosophies or working with similar collections. The collections were not similar enough to explain this pattern, as they varied from sculptural reconstructions at Cabestany, to historical landscape and ecology at Lastours. The political-cultural explanation would be a common guiding ideology, while the standard free-market explanation would be a common customer base. My theory ended up somewhere in between.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
I first examined the managerial structure of these museums and their institutional histories. They were all built from 2000-2009, more of less complete with their exhibitions, with little planning for temporary or exhibit changes. They were all owned by the municipality, and funded by a mixture of municipal and regional public sector funds. They did not own their collections outright, but were patched together from projects funded by local governments and the museums themselves.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
As such, these museums did not have independent foundation boards. They had only a skeleton front desk staff and maybe two or three directors and volunteer coordinators in the back office. In a typical American museum of similar size, there would be at least thirty full time employees working in educational programs, maintenance of the collection, advertising, and debating internally how to arrange new exhibitions. In the United States, these are considered core museological functions, but in the museums visited, these functions were not undertaken by professional museum workers, but officials in the local government or regional tourism authority.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
In the United States, this externalization of core museological functions would constitute the height of undue government interference. Even ostentatiously public museums like the Smithsonian Institution or the University of California museums have large staffs which take care of these function in-house, and trustees who, although appointed by public bodies, guarantee the independence of museum workers and own outright the entire collection.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
In France however, this doesn’t appear to be the case. In interviews with museum workers and volunteers, the only major complaint that was consistent was the lack of funding for operations costs and the desire for more money from the national government. In regional tourism or municipal officials who made major exhibition decisions, there was no sense that they were they, as policy generalists, were making decisions that should be reserved to museum specialists.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
This attitude, and the concept of a public museum, makes much more sense in the context of the French “Cultural State”. Historically, the French monarchy initially used museums, or public displays of the royal collections, as Renaissance princes would, to impress upon visitors their sophistication and power. After the Revolution, the new republican regime used the old royal collections like the Louvre or the diamond collection to create a national identity. High Parisian culture became French culture, and museums played a key part in a single culture which aimed to be prescriptive, and not descriptive, of France at the time.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
The unusually large budget of the Ministry of Culture, in the hands of a politician, has naturally lent itself to ministers and Presidents of the Republic wanting to make a name for themselves with large projects in the vicinity of Paris. The Pompidou Center, the Louvre renovation, and the National Opera House are all affiliated with particular presidents of ministers of culture. Consistent with its centralizing origins, even today the ministry has little internal institutional checks on the minister. The minister receives as much or as little professional advice as they ask for.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
After the War, a succession of socialist governments attempted to democratize and decentralize the primacy of Paris in France’s cultural agenda. Hence, for the first time, substantial amounts of funding from the Ministry of Culture went to regional tourism authorities, with the expectation that the money “be felt”. Hence, from 2000 to 2009, a succession of very modern museums, with great promises of cooperation with local school systems and extensive volunteer programs were built throughout Languedoc-Roussillon in conjunction with local villes and agglomerations. While Parisian money, coming through the Ministry of Culture and the Region of Languedoc-Roussillon, provided the initial capital investment for the museum, governance, improvements, and management was left in the hands of municipalities.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Hence, today there are a large number of local, public museums in Languedoc-Roussillon. Because they were all built around the same time, they have similar aesthetics and spatial arrangements. Because they were essentially conceived by the regional tourism authorities, they all use local improvisations on the regional brand Sud de France: notre marque. Consistent with the unity of French identity, they do not actively encourage an Occitan consciousness, but instead substitute bilingual French-Catalan childrens books for an air of distinctness. They create the idea of a southern French lifestyle, culture, but also history, which is unique; but in order to attract tourism to the small towns that are the bedrock of the tourism industry, they must also recognize the historical diversity internal to the Languedoc.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
This diffuse brand, in its larger sense, enables Lastours, with its ecological and mining heritage, along with its Cathar and French history, to shine through. It allows the Master of Cabestany and Roman Narbonne’s stories to transcend modern nation-state boundaries, in a different way from the universalism of metropolitan French culture. This is a remarkable example, in the private sector, of an economically successful tourism branding which still allows for the complexities inherent in cultural heritage, or at least as much as the population is willing to support.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
In the public museums studied here, however, they are still dependant on the public sector in a manner that would be considered completely unsustainable in the United States. In spite of their very vocal lack of national funding, regional museums are effectively fully subsidized, and therefore controlled, by the municipality. It allows for for little change in exhibitions, nonexistent museum independence, but also non existent responsibility. Revenue is negligible, as most museums are free, and only the gift shops and tours are charged. They have minimal fundraising efforts, and their greatest weakness is their dependence on the public purse.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
The region built, municipality owned museum is a complete model. Within the context of the French cultural state, it explains a number of the similarities seen in the museums mentioned here, as well as others. It will be interesting to see how the reorganization of the French regional system will affect this system, and if these local museums prove useful or sustainable if further cuts to the non-personnel public expenditure prove necessary.&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Bertran de Born and Paratge in &quot;B&#039;em platz lo gais temps de pascor&quot;</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/bertran-de-born-and-paratge-bem-platz-lo-gais-temps-de-pascor</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement of intent: I hope to explore the material grounding of lineage and honor in Betran de Born&amp;#039;s canos &amp;quot;B&amp;#039;em platz lo gais temps de pascor&amp;quot; in this project.Thicker than Water:Bertran de Born’s Quest for Rebirth in “Be’m platz lo gais temps de pascor”To reach the castle at Quéribus, tourists climb a craggy, sandy path that weaves steeply up the mountainside. From outside, the castle looms darkly down at the viewer; from inside, it corners the inhabitant with its angled walls. Gérard Zuchetto begins to chant Bertran de Born’s “Be’m platz lo gais temps de pascor” and his voice echoes in an eerie, thin way. No one speaks. The song enters my ears from a distant, unknowable past, a past that does not belong to me. It speaks to a people rooted for generations in the landscape and feudal traditions of Occitania. In his 12th century canso “Be’m platz lo gais temps de pascor,” Bertran de Born wishes to revive a local pride in lineage and honor in battle in order to call his men to arms. In doing so, he posits the system of paratge as a means to Christ-like bodily resurrection through physical communion with both lovers and foes.“Be’m platz lo gais temps de pascor” speaks to Bertran de Born’s historically evidenced appetite for war. He made war with the count of Périgord, the count of Limoges, his brother Constantin, and with Richard the Lionheart during his time as châtelain of Hautefort (Zuchetto 1.) In much of his poetry, he sexualizes and glorifies battles and sieges, although he writes cansos as well as tensos. In Dante’s Inferno, Dante and Vergil see Bertran beheaded and forced to carry his own head forever as a punishment for sowing discord between Henry II Plantagenet and his son Henry the Young King (Alighieri 3.) “Be’m platz lo gais temps de pascor” expresses this drive to war-making through the lens of paratge, an Occitan word whose meanings include “peerage,” “natural order” and “birth.” In the canso, Bertran suggests that a return to honorable participation in battle will lead to a rebirth and revival of the values implicit in paratge.Bertran de Born’s narrative persona in “Be’m platz lo gais temps de pascor” witnesses both violent and sexual invasions of the human body. Fajardo-Acosta views the invasion and consumption of bodies as a communion of self and other: “[Cannibalism] achieves…the effacing of the boundary between subject and object” (Fajardo-Acosta 67.) The unity of two bodies in violent, consumptive contact bridges the gap created by seriality for Fajardo-Acosta. Frank situates troubadour poetry within a medieval naturalistic dualism of body and soul: “The distinction between body and spirit was lessened” (Frank 71-72.) Frank fits the secular eroticism of troubadour songs into a Thomistic dualist paradigm. For Rouben Cholakian, penetrating the castle tower to plead with the domna becomes a phallic play for power: “At the heart of the matter…is the unceasing gamble for mastery” (Cholakian 30.) The lady becomes a signifier of social status and the troubadour a social climber. However, Cholakian, Frank, and Fajardo-Acosta do not explicitly state that in participating in a communion with his enemy’s body, the narrator renews his commitment to the contract of paratge that binds him to his lineage and his community.Bertran’s narrator mimics the canso’s natureingang, or nature opening, in order to posit a revival of the system of paratge:B’em platz lo gais temps de pascorQue fai fuolhas e flors venir (1-2)Bertran mirrors the birdsong of a natureingang in line 3 in order to parallel the creation of a conventional canso, as well as that of the fin’amors usually expressed. However, he diverges from tradition in two ways: first by explicitly mentioning Easter in the opening line of the poem, then by introducing the imagery of war tents, armed knights, horses in line 7. Bertran’s songbird heralds the creation of war. He resolves the contrastive tension between the renewal of the land and song that springtime suggests and the destruction of life on the battlefield by alluding to Christ’s resurrection. Just as the landscape comes to life again each spring, Easter celebrates Christ’s revival every year. Christ’s resurrected body mirrors the structure of paratge, of the natural order of theological and social hierarchies, in its perpetual renewal in blood. Just as many Christians renew their faith by eating of the body and blood of Christ during communion, participants in the social order of paratge renew their commitment to their ancestry, land, and community by engaging in communion through battle. By consuming the enemy’s body in penetrating its integrity in battle, knights and other fighters avow their devotion to the place and people for whom they fight.             Bertran’s narrator’s communion with the body of the landscape and, correspondingly, with the body of his community also comes to light in the word “pascor.” In the ceremony of the Eucharist, believers partake of the body and blood of Christ. Similarly, Bertran suggests that the narrator comes into spiritual contact with these materials by partaking of the blood of his fallen enemy, which reflects the vein of Occitan feudal tradition in the context of the canso’s setting in Betran’s native Périgord. Just as those who participate in the Eucharist drink wine that becomes Christ’s blood, Bertran alludes to trees, leaves, and birds that become Périgord’s material essence, its landscape. In the springtime opening, Bertran imagines a revival of this basic substance, a renewal of the most key elements of Périgord’s tradition. The central placement of the word paratge in stanza IV, as well as Bertran’s references to components of it such as agradatge and ses temor, suggests that this system of courtly order forms the base of this material. Bertran posits paratge as the lifeblood of Périgord’s springtime renewal.In the sole physical exchange in “Be’m plai lo gais temps de pascor”, Bertran’s narrator extolls the communion of fighters’ bodies:e segre’l d’agradatgeque nuills hom non es re presatztro q’a mains colps pres e donatz (28-30)The plurality of negations in line 28 (“nuills,” “non,” “re”) creates an ambiguous subject-object relationship in order to demonstrate the need for a concrete code of conduct. The stress of the line falls on “re,” the most ambiguous term in the phrase: it could mean anything or nothing, like the French rien; it could mean “body” or even “meat.” The negations “nuills” and “non” that precede it open up a poetic and metrical space for a concrete object – they raise the question of what the man lacks. However, Bertran subverts this expectation by centering the line on the vacillating “re.” Because the word has so many meanings, it profoundly devalues the subject of the sentence. He cannot take part in communion with his enemy’s body or commune with his fellow men due to his conditional lack of respect: he must give and receive blows to be worth anything. The shifting “ren” acts as a lock to which only Bertran possesses the verbal key; he uses it to demonstrate the vacuum of courtly cultural structure that would come about without the rules of warfare. Once again, Bertran positions communion with one’s enemy in battle as the means to reviving the honor code of paratge.The knights within the lyric participate in communion through the interpenetration of their bodies in line 29. Knights must both receive and give violent blows before gaining respect as courtly men: “q’a mains colps pres e donatz” (29.) Once attacked, a knight must retaliate; inaction would suggest lack of dignity. However, to earn respect, one must also receive a blow. A knight must accept an invasion of his bodily space in order to become a man; he must accept the risk implicit in his role as a protector of the existing structure. Paratge becomes evident in this relatively equal exchange of blows: a knight can gain no honor fighting against someone who does not fight back. He must desire the enemy’s reaction in order to continue the battle. The fight forms both men in building their resistance to fear as well as their desire for war and its danger. Their bodily interchange reflects the value of equal exchange inherent in paratge as the economic building block of the social hierarchy created by paratge.The feudal lord must follow the patterns of paratge as well in order to inspire the knights who serve him. Knights must follow him gladly into battle in order to fight at all: “e segre’l d’agradatge” (28.) Not only must they receive and give blows, but they must also desire war. The happiness (agradatge) of the knights reflects an unhesitating commitment to the role they must play both as chivalrous fighters and as subjects of the lord. Bertran’s code of conduct demands that they enjoy whatever the form of warfare they must participate in according to the need. The knights’ physical desire for war reveals their bloodline, which holds long ties to the land and people that they defend. Not only does their willingness to fight reflect their dedication to their families, land, and communities, but it also unveils their lineage. Because generations of their ancestors fought to defend their land and people, so should future generations tied by blood to their predecessors. Betran roots his code of paratge in the bloodlines of the knights who fight to renew the social order that their ancestors protected with their lives.Moreover, Bertran’s liberal use of fricatives to fracture rhythm and sound reflects the fragmentation of deserters’ bodies in “Be’m plai lo gais temps de pascor”:chascus hom de paratgenon pens mas d’asclar caps e bratzcar mais val mortz qe vius sobratz (38-40)Each man of high rank must enter the fray in order to fulfill the promise of his bloodline: “chascus hom de paratge” (38.) As courtly knights within a tradition of chivalric war, men of rank must participate in battle partly as a result of an unseen cultural expectation. The harsh fricative sounds “p,” “ch,” “s,” and “g” evoke the sounds of swords clashing in battle as well as the fixed role for each nobleman. Each knight must comply with the actions expected of him not just by his community, but also by the Occitan chivalric tradition within which he lives and acts. Bertran’s use of fricatives and a tightly structured meter mostly composed of masculine rhymes reflects each man’s duty to fulfill these rigid hierarchies.  Finally, Bertran utilizes fricatives to condemn those who do not feel and participate in the desire for war that he glorifies: “mortz qe vius sobratz” (30.) The “s” and “tz” sounds of “sobratz” condemn the treachery of the vanquished survivors with their harsh noises, which recall serpents’ hisses. These defeated men occupy a liminal space, both literally and figuratively: they must concede land to their conquerors but they do not usually join them. Furthermore, they do not fragment their enemies’ bodies to the extent that they win, but they do not receive enough blows to die. This ambiguity reflects their lack of commitment to their bloodlines for Bertran de Born. He can neither view them as agents who play their part, nor as martyrs; he believes their desire for peace reveals a weakness in their blood. Bertran condemns the deserters for failing to follow the chivalric code of honor in valuing their lives over the defense of their land and people – their refusal to partake in communion with their enemies reflects their rejection of their social and familial obligations to paratge.Bertran’s poetic persona aspires to know the body of a lady for the same reasons as he wishes to kill his foes: because his blood tells him to do so. His idealized knight, in entering the domna’s body, divides her from her sins:E domna c’ab aital drut jazes monad de tots sos pechatz (59-60)The imagined woman occupies the role of a domna, a masculine figure who has a specific role in the narrative as a signifier of courtliness. She acts as the subject of the sentence in choosing to engage in sexual intercourse with the imagined ideal knight due to his prowess in battle and his courtliness. Her desire, too, stems from a belief in cortezia, in the unwritten rules of conduct in the court that run in her aristocratic blood. Because the knight shares the same kind of courtly and chivalric code, he can fulfill her desires in a way that his fellow knights will accept and even cleanse her of her sins through his very courtliness. The material grounding of the act of purifying sexual contact reflects the role of the knight’s lineage, paratge, in his renewing powers. Just as he renews Périgord’s landscape through his commitment to the natural order of paratge, so does he renew the purity of his domna through his courtly devotion.Ultimately, the imagined lady benefits from the act of love, because the idealized knight cleanses her of her sins (“sos pechatz.”) His martial and sexual desires better even the sacred domna as a result of their grounding in the courtly rules of paratge. The knight’s desires find form in the bodies of his enemies and his lovers, in battle and in bed, but they spring from an internal, material desire coded in his blood. In this way, Bertran posits a revival of true paratge, by including its internality, its basis in blood. The knight’s desire for fin’amors and for battle offer a means to salvation through renewal of old codes written in the bloodlines of the local lords. He desires love and war spontaneously and then follows these codes materially. In doing so, he fulfills their promise of order and balance. The equal weight that he gives to his enemies, the worthiness of his lovers and his foes, and his desire to engage with each of them correctly renews the overarching system of paratge with the blows he gives to his enemies and the refined love he submits to his lady. In a communion with past generations, his peers partake of his body and blood to create a new future grounded in old codes and old blood. Bertran’s unnamed knight becomes a Christ-like figure for the resurrection of Occitan paratge through physical desire.&lt;br /&gt;
  In “Be’m platz lo gais temps de pascor,” Bertran de Born represents both love and war as means to renew one’s community through material desire. The impulse to commune with the internal spaces of someone’s body, he argues, reveals a knight’s own interiority, both material and spiritual. Bertran’s knight sacrifices his body willingly, through both his base and courtly desires, and in doing so revives the spirit of war as well as that of courtly love. His bloodline and his spiritual grace anchor his community in the generations-old, coded system of paratge that Bertran extolls. This system demands a willing desire, which the knight manifests openly and naturally, reflecting the natural order that paratge creates. Gérard Zuchetto closed his eyes with emotion when he sang “Be’m platz lo gais temps de pascor” in the castle’s throne room at Quéribus; his voice fell easily into the marching meter of the song. Even today, Bertran writes a code that governs the land and the people in Occitan spaces; his song renews itself in the blood of its inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Conversion in Alfonso&#039;s Cantigas de Santa Maria</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/conversion-alfonsos-cantigas-de-santa-maria</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his fourth Cantiga de Santa Maria, Alfonso narrates the conversion of a Jewish mother and son to Christianity after the father attempts to burn the son alive for receiving communion from the Virgin Mary. Mary acts as a guide towards the vera vía of Christianity by giving the Jewish boy communion; although she still acts as a powerful domna, she is much less sexualized and physically idealized than the domnas of previous troubadours. She presents an image that Alfonso describes as &amp;quot;resplendent&amp;quot; as she cradles her son in her arms. Whereas Bertran de Born and his peers lavish attention on the blonde hair, white skin, and well-formed limbs of their domnas, Alfonso addresses both the maternal and the virginal aspects of Mary. She acts as a desexualized, ephemeral mother figure rather than an object of sexual (and social) desire. Her decision to save the Jewish boy underscores this parallel with a nurturing but authoritative figure as she protects him from harm and guides his decision to convert to Christianity. Like the domnas of previous troubadours, Mary acts as a manifestation of moral virtue, but unlike them she uses her place at God&amp;#039;s side to guide her devotees towards the vera vía of complying with these virtues. Her moral and spiritual authority allows her to influence the goings-on in her followers&amp;#039; lives, unlike the remote, inactive domna of previous troubadours.    Of course, Alfonso has his own political agenda to encourage Jewish people to convert to Christianity in order to cement his power. The Jewish father&amp;#039;s death in the furnace at the end of the cantiga provides a model for others who don&amp;#039;t believe in the Virgin Mary&amp;#039;s miraculous deeds. The video on the Cantigas de Santa Maria included a story of a Jewish man who defecated on an image of the Virgin Mary who also met a gruesome end. Both cantigas reveal Alfonso&amp;#039;s use of fear to convert Jewish people to Christianity as a means of ensuring the diffusion and duration of his own Christian rule, which forms part of the vera vía towards which the Cantigas guide their devotees. This religious, political and moral impulse sets Alfonso apart from the previous troubadours.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Evolution of the Trobairitz: La Comtessa de Dia v. Joni Mitchell</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/evolution-trobairitz-la-comtessa-de-dia-v-joni-mitchell</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the vida of la Comtessa de Dia does not say much, we know from her forthright cansos that she was a strong woman who believed in the female right to declare her love. She often sung of romantic longing and sensuous desire, &amp;quot;reclaiming and reconverting the role of love&amp;#039;s marytr&amp;quot; (Bruckner et. al. xxx). La Comtessa de Dia is, in fact, the most famous and influential trobairitz of her time. A feminist and revolutionary, she assumes the typical male role in the song; she demands the power in the relationship. Joni Mitchell, similarly, is considered one of the most important and renowned female musicians and singer-songwriters of the 21st century. She composed her own songs on the guitar, conjuring chords that had never before been mastered. Her music has influenced male and female artists after her: Led Zeppelin, Morrissey, Stevie Nicks, Madonna, Kurt Cobain and Cat Power. Like la Comtessa, she openly conveyed her longing in her songs. For my creative project, I was interested in the evolution of the trobairitz from the Medieval period to modern-day. I decided to juxtapose the lyrics of la Comtessa de Dia and Joni Mitchell, who in my mind are both strong women declaring their love and desire to the world. Indeed, the common themes in their lyrics were pride, love, and the constant tug of war between the two. In &amp;quot;A chanter m&amp;#039;er,&amp;quot; la Comtessa regrets having to sing about such a sore subject, but she does so anyway. She admonishes the man for being too prideful, when she is arguably too proud herself. Joni Mitchell, on the other hand, understands her position as a strong female and trumpets &amp;quot;the lady&amp;#039;s choice&amp;quot; in still loving a man who has betrayed her. However, Mitchell shows strength and pride in her vulnerability. She told Rolling Stone, &amp;quot;At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn&amp;#039;t pretend in my life to be strong.&amp;quot; Surrendering the pretense, she was able to truly declare her feelings and still exude the same passion and strength that la Comtessa does in her song. After comparing their lyrics, I wanted to portray the evolution and the deconstruction of pride in trobairitz culture through image. In order to do so, I captured my own images to show the continuity (and discontinuity) of certain trobairitz. Troubadours and trobairitz, unfortunately, are only really ever captured in image as a very stylized icon. Still, the icon of la Comtessa is telling of the trobairitz culture in that era: a woman beautiful in her own right shows strength by declaring her desire. Her stance, hand gesture, costume and lack of instrument show that she is a woman of status and above any jongleur. On the other hand, the more modern image of Joni Mitchell shows how far trobairitz have gone since the Middle Ages. The portrayal of Mitchell is more organic than stylized and more liberated than trapped within the confines of pride. Her costume, heels, and facial expression are her respective signs of strength. While both women show strength in their lyric and image, it is clear that the idea of feminism has evolved according to the temporal contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Atticus&#039; Final </title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my creative project, I set out to show that the troubadours of today were not all that different than the troubadours of the Occitan. While the troubadours of the Occitan varied greatly in their styles, rhetoric, and topics I found that, for the most part, they adhere to three main guidelines. The troubadours discuss relevant social, political, and cultural issues in a lyrical form; the songs are usually focused on the ‘desire’ for an unattainable or unnamed woman; and the validity of the troubadour himself is based on the amount of truth (fin’amor) that they are able to portray or unveil. Today, troubadours are still united by these same principles. Troubadours today discuss cultural, political and social issues; a large proportion of the most popular songs today are still directed at an unnamed or unattainable woman. While truth plays a similar role, the genuineness of the modern troubadour is now paramount. This genuineness combined with marketability or a supportive following creates a successful troubadour today. Without funding from a King or a Court, the modern troubadours can outsource their patronage to the common people, and thus ‘success’ is defined by being ‘popular’. Hot Chip, a modern alternative dance/rock band from London, formed in 2000. They have released 5 studio albums, they received one Grammy nomination in 2009 for Best Dance Recording, and they also received two nomination from the Virgin Media Awards for Best Album and Best Video in 2010. While not constantly at the top of the charts, this is a very popular and relevant band in the 21st century. The Best Video nomination was for the music video of their song I Feel Better, which is the topic of my analysis. The lyrics of this song follows troubadour style, but is much simpler and repetitive than the original troubadours; a simplification of poetry for popularity and catchiness’ sake. However, they still discuss a lady and a modern socio-cultural outlook on the world. The first line reads, “She said, ‘How’d we get so lost?”, setting up a relationship between a man and a woman. All the male singer wants is one night in her arms, but it is unattainable. “Maybe if we’d never come this way/Then we would live and prosper/But I doubt it/We are a violent race” is the second verse, showing that were it not for the society and culture that they are a part of, they would be able to be together. Just like a modern Marcabru, using the metaphor of an unknown lady to show the faults of modern society. As the video begins, there is a false version of Hot Chip presented singing Hot Chips music. These false troubadours dance and sing and profess their genuineness. Then a shining white floating man, the (ugly) truth, the truest of troubadours, and the bodily representation of fin’amor or bel’saber appears. He shocks the crowd and floats to the stage. As each one of the false trobars tries to prove themselves, they are vaporized with a laser-beam of truth. Finally, as they are all destroyed there is peace. Then, there is a unity of all the troubadours, both true and false, now dancing together under the lead of the shining man in white. Just as any troubadour, such as Piere Cardenal or Marcabru, the modern troubadour must discount the modern state of song, lyric, and trobar, and while deflating it must pronounce themselves the greatest of all troubadours. Through this video, Hot Chip is able to do just that. However, they are also aware that no matter how true a troubadour can be, there is always a higher order of judgment waiting to skew their work. There is another floating head that appears at the back of the audience. No longer a troubadour, it is just a floating head, mouthing the lyrics of the song. After shooting, not blue lasers of truth, but red lasers of judgment, everything and everyone in the concert space is destroyed, save the floating head. I believe that this shows that no matter how true a troubadour professes to be, they must be aware that someone is going to misrepresent them, or at the very least skew the original intent of the music. For instance, an album review, not winning the award for the video, someone playing the song out of their low-quality laptop speakers instead of seeing it live; the list goes on of major and minor corruptions to the quality and soul of the music. I believe that by having this same basic thematic structure, and also by being aware of all of the different things troubadours must do in order to be true to themselves and the art form (all while maintaining a following) is the linking factor of all troubadours for the past 1000 years. While the mediums and messages and languages have changed, the basic DNA of the troubadour has not, and I believe that trobar is alive and well in modern music and society. By D. Atticus Anderson&lt;/p&gt;
