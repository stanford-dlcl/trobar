I&amp;#039;m tryna raise the bar highWho tryna jump and get it? You better off tryna skydiveOut the exit window of 5 G5&amp;#039;s with 5 grandWith your granddad as the pilot he drunk as fuck tryna landWith the hand full of arthritis and popping prosthetic legBumpin Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his headIs an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess saidThat your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread Even hundreds of years after the troubadours sang through the hallways of medieval castles, the influence of the lyric poet remains. Troubadour themes transcend the boundaries imposed by time and the limitations of genre, evident in even the most unlikely sources: modern rap. By focusing on Peire d&amp;#039;Alvernhe&amp;#039;s sirventes Chantarai d&amp;#039;Aquest Troubadours and Kendrick Lamar&amp;#039;s scathing verse on Big Sean&amp;#039;s Control, we can explore the parallels that run between the two incredibly different sources. Both lyricists made extensive use of the art of the insult, referencing great artists from each respective time period in order to glorify their own skill with wordplay. Each song also references some popular troubadour themes, such as pride, respect for the craft, and respect for the artist. Though it is difficult to ascertain the motivation behind the creation of these songs, the effect that each has had on music is unmistakable and widespread. Some of the troubadours mentioned by Peire d&amp;#039;Alvernhe are only remembered in the annals of time because of Peire&amp;#039;s biting words. Kendrick Lamar&amp;#039;s verse has garnered responses from even those he did not mention; he proved his words were far-reaching when even comedians and professional athletes acknowledged his claims. It is highly unlikely that Kendrick Lamar studied the art of the troubadours, nevertheless the works of Peire d&amp;#039;Alvernhe.  However, his works remain influenced by troubadour themes. By drawing parallels between these artists and their works, I am able to understand each piece to a greater extent. As such, I have gained a deeper understanding of works created nine centuries apart, and gain a new appreciation for not only the wordplay of modern rappers, but the troubadours that started it all. I have attached a video of Kendrick Lamar&amp;#039;s verse on Control, as well as included an excerpt of the lyrics from the song. You can also find a pdf version of my slides from the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
