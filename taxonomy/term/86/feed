The casualties of war are great personal motivators for hatred and violence later on in life. For instance, Severus Snape lost the love of his life in a war that ostensibly ended the day she died. For years afterwards, he hated her son not only on the principle that she may have lived if he had not existed, but also because he served as a reminder that she never truly loved him, even while alive. This interesting mixture of actions and motivations creates three dimensional characters who have both villainous and heroic qualities.  &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Explosive Arts in Inglourious Basterds</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/explosive-arts-inglourious-basterds</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we see a great encapsulation of the melange of erotic love and war to form an artwork of clearly ideological intent. Set in an alternate historical version of Nazi Germany, Tarantino&amp;#039;s Inglourious Basterds focuses in part on the story of Jewish resistance fighter Shoshanna Laurent, who is embroiled in an unrquited love affair with German war hero Friedrich Zoller. Unconsummated erotic love drives Zoller&amp;#039;s actions in the movie, and in the first clip we can see his sexual libido for Shoshanna lead to his downfall. In terms of the ideological content of the artwork shown in the film, we can see a two-sided portrayal of wartime justification. The film in question, as we can see in the first thirty seconds of the second clip, is an act of German propaganda. In the world of the film, it is commissioned by Goebbels in order to highlight German heroics in the war and to spur public support for the war effort. Of course, this stated goal is entirely inverted by Shoshanna&amp;#039;s actions, which render the film an act of counter-resistance, with the Allied Powers&amp;#039; plan to destro Hitler coming to complete frustration. Although she may die herself as a direct result of eroticised love, Shoshanna is stable to change the course of war by means of art.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-course field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Course:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt; Songs of Love and War: Gender, Crusade, Politics (Sp16-FEMGEN-205-01/FRENCH-205-01)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-video field-type-video-embed-field field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;

 <title>House of Cards, as explained by someone who does not watch House of Cards</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/house-cards-explained-someone-who-does-not-watch-house-cards</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links to images:&lt;br /&gt;
Frank and Claire, inches away and hearts apart&lt;br /&gt;
Frank, Claire, Zoe, and that one gentleman Frank murdered &lt;br /&gt;
For Frank and Claire, the devil is in the details. As a team, they wage war on the establishment in Washington, clearing a path to power much like General Sherman cleared a path to the sea. Drawn together by ruthlessness and a seeming lack of a moral compass, Frank and Claire are the perfect duo. That is to say, the perfect duo to leave a man in his car to die of carbon monoxide poisoning, and then fake their sympathy for his death. But these are secondary details. Yet as they build a fortress around Frank&amp;#039;s reputation, this discreet Bonnie and Clyde duo face their own internal battles. Distrust, Siberian-cold-personalities, and poker faces of stone often turn Frank and Claire against one another. The couple often cheat on one another (and they both know it). These extramarital affairs, such as Frank&amp;#039;s ultimately murderous affair with Zoe, and Claire&amp;#039;s interest in that one artist fellow, seem to render their mutual cause asunder. In these moments of separation, Frank and Claire push each other apart, and go to wage their own battles. There is an intangible black hole swirling between them, driven by that same distrust they target at their opponents like high-powered laser beams. Peace (and perhaps even understanding) between them is intangible, much like the climate of Washington itself. Yet, like the pull of a black hole, Frank and Claire are drawn back together. Their individual struggles are fused together, fueling their crusade against the other political elites, and burning a path to the top. It is true: the best relationships are based on hating the same things together.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-course field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Course:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt; Songs of Love and War: Gender, Crusade, Politics (Sp16-FEMGEN-205-01/FRENCH-205-01)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/response&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Looking at modern relationships through medieval dialogue</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/looking-modern-relationships-through-medieval-dialogue</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I looked at the dialogue between Maria de Ventadorn and Gui d&amp;#039;Ussel. This poem caught my attention with the words, &amp;quot;I rightly consider him a traitor if, having given himself as servant, he makes himself an equal&amp;quot;. On the other hand, Gui d&amp;#039;Ussel argues that &amp;quot;she should...consider equal the man with whom she&amp;#039;s joined two hearts as one&amp;quot;. This reminded me of the dynamic of a new relationship vs. a long term one. In the former, the guy typically spends a lot of energy pursuing his love interest, doing favors for her and continually trying to impress her. Once love has been attained, he begins to put less effort into the endeavor, and in modern relationships, the two participants are considered equals. According to Maria de Ventadorn, the man should always act as if he was in continuous pursuit of his love, and in this video, it is easy to see why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-course field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Course:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt; Songs of Love and War: Gender, Crusade, Politics (Sp16-FEMGEN-205-01/FRENCH-205-01)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-video field-type-video-embed-field field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;

 <title>Dual Nature in Dialogue songs and the Hudson River School</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/dual-nature-dialogue-songs-and-hudson-river-school</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of what struck me about Marcabru and Ugo Catola&amp;#039;s song is the insistence by each singer that love is either pure and virtuous or liable to be corrupted and dangerous.  Marcabru praises a true fin&amp;#039; amor, but he appears much more skeptical and cautious than Catola.  Catola refuses to admit that love carries this danger, trying to categorically exclude it from the story of Sampson and Delilah by arguing that Marcabru&amp;#039;s memory of the story&amp;#039;s timeline is faulty.  The dual presence of a delightful and wholesome image of love and a dark and destructive one in the poem reminded me very much of tbe American Hudson River school of landscape paintings, which beautifully and sometimes starkly portray the Romantic movement&amp;#039;s dual fascination with the light and traditionally beautiful picturesque aesthetic and simultaneously with a powerful and destructive sublimity.  Thomas Cole&amp;#039;s View from Mount Holyoke, Massachusetts, after a Thunderstorm (1836) is a particularly good illustration of this dual fascination since the picture is separated along a diagonal line according to its light and dark aesthetics, as the division of the speakers in the dialogue song clearly marks their differing views.  One crucial differnece, of course, is that love&amp;#039;s treachery does not contribute to its beauty for Marcabru the way the gathering storm seems to be aesthetically valuable for Cole.  At the same time, I believe the painting captures the way that doubt overtakes the overall tone of the song--once it is introduced, the poem as a whole becomes doubtful of love thorugh its argument, and the dark clouds at the edge of Cole&amp;#039;s painting in a similar way make it a picture not of two weather conditions but of a landscape recently or imminently threated by a storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-course field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Course:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt; Songs of Love and War: Gender, Crusade, Politics (Sp16-FEMGEN-205-01/FRENCH-205-01)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/response&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Dialogue through metal</title>

In this song, while the two singers have the same message for the other; each tries to dominate in terms of claiming that they will do the most damage. This is done through trying to be the most melodic or trying to have the most pained or aggressive scream. The song would be incomplete without their harmonies, just as the dialogue poems would be incomplete without both halves of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Against Taruskin &quot;Authenticity&quot;: Needed for Understanding but not Performance</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/against-taruskin-authenticity-needed-understanding-not-performance</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taruskin goes into depth on practices of how to actually embody the &amp;quot;authentic&amp;quot; troubadour, especially in performance. I agree with Taruskin in the fact that a &amp;quot;historical authentic performance&amp;quot; is necessary, however, I don&amp;#039;t agree that it is the main/only way performers should be allowed to express their performance. With ties to our classroom discussion and meeting with the musicians, we were able to see all the ambiguities that goes into performing historical performances in a modern era. Because the troubadour&amp;#039;s poems were heavily undocumented, a lot of assumption are made when deciding how to display their pieces in a way that is similar to how it was originally performed by the troubadours. Here is where Taruskin&amp;#039;s argument becomes important. We need to have a historically authentic analyzation of the poems in order to establish some type of base that many scholars can agree with, because, as Marisa mentioned, this is not just music anymore, it is science. We also saw this in class when the musician said that after she used her own knowledge on how she believes a certain piece should be performed, she checked on Youtube or other online resources to see how others interpreted it. She also mentioned that for certain songs there was always a common pattern between all the performers. This common pattern comes from the importance of the tying in history such that the performance feels as it was made to feel, again emphasized by Taruskin.My main issue comes with the sternness of Taruskin as he argues over the importance for a historically authentic performance to a point that ANY deviations from the historical context of the time when the song was made results in an incorrect/faulty performance. This is simply not true. We must realize that even with all historical context being put into place when performing a trobar (song written by a troubadour/trobairitz), modern performers will still need to improvise certain aspects of the performance. This is mainly because most poems in chansonniers didn&amp;#039;t include things like pitch, tone, tempo, etc. that are included in modern scores. When making these guesses, what then should a modern performer think off? My answer would be the modern audience.The troubadours performed their pieces in a way that suited their illiterate audiences who also didn&amp;#039;t know many other aspects of music that we use today. How a modern audience receives a performance is a lot different from how the people of 11-13th century France did. We are more literate. We know various music stylings and harmonies. We listen to rhyme and rhythm, but we also are able to pay attention to more complex performance aspects. Because of all this, modern performers should be allowed to add more modern aspects to a performance of a historical piece simply because the end goal isn&amp;#039;t just the performance but also the deliverance of whatever message the author was trying to get out.Though Taruskin provides a clear way for performing (delivering the message) by staying strictly within the bounds of the historical context, we must not allow ourselves to be ignorant. The fact is, that now, there are more ways to deliver a message through a performance then there was in during the 11-13th century. Not allowing performers to access these modern performance aspects simply because they are out of a historical context may create grounds for a misdelivered message to a modern audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-course field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Course:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt; Songs of Love and War: Gender, Crusade, Politics (Sp16-FEMGEN-205-01/FRENCH-205-01)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/response&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Jehan Bodel’s political message in this passage is almost comically clear, and I can almost imagine the audience at the time almost rolling their eyes at the simplicity of this message. It resembles the children’s stories where little kids are taught not to steal (or some such moral lesson) in the most basic and unambiguous terms. The narrative of the King is one of redemption rather than damnation. The church would have wanted to enforce this, as rather than having to authorize the killing of potential heretics it would be easier to convert them. This would add to their strength as a political and religious force. Carol Symes discusses how the location of the play “heightens and collapses the distinction between reality and fiction” – this would have been particularly necessary as the church would not be enforcing these plays for purely entertainment value. The Jeu de Saint Nicholas’ play is in some way a call to arms to the Christians to convert the Pagans and be like the laudable Prudhomme. It would have also served as an incentive to any covert heretics, sending the message that they would be met with redemption just as the Pagan King was. Symes explains that if the play was “mounted in a church, it would draw on the perennial associations of liturgical plays, which regularly staged the betrayal and arrest of virtuous men.” While I think this is true, I think this de-emphasizes the political importance of this staging. It goes back to Symes earlier quote that the “distinction between reality and fiction” would partially collapse. It is equally a threat and an assertion of power. By performing a story of one of Christianity’s triumphs on the foundation of the current religious center, reemphasizes the almost all-powerful nature of the organization. It also reminds the audience that it is not merely a building, but one blessed with supernatural aid. With Bodel’s story a kind of fictitious proof is given, as “the Saint and his great miracle” is depicted as a validation for the church’s complete authority over the populous lives. There is also the literal building to consider, as the pagan King is “himself baptized at the font”, it is a reminder that any one can be baptized and the same font that baptizes the actor “king” could be used to baptize any citizen. This would elevate the stature of Christianity and give it an immediacy and status in which the citizens could take pride in.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Meter and Rhyme in Pierre Vidal&#039;s Canso</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/meter-and-rhyme-pierre-vidals-canso</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Switten digs into the musicology of the troubadour music, he points out that no medieval sounds have been passed down to our ears.  Unfortunately, the troubadours did not have recording devices on their iPhones, but we can draw information on how they sung in chansonniers or in trouveres, where only about 10% of troubadour poems are preserved with melodies.  In addition, there is no one, “authoritative song” (Switten, 142) because a song would be manipulated from performance to performance.  The troubadours revolutionized music through versification, controlling meter and rhyme.  Switten teaches us that while versification is presently common day, “possibilities of combination and recombination served as a powerful stimulus to troubadour invention of new patterns of verbal sound” (Switten, 143).  First, in meter, syllable count was important, but the number of syllables in a vers relied on the last accented syllable.  If a word was accented on the last syllable, then that rhyme would be masculine, and if a word was accented on the second to last syllable, then that rhyme would be feminine.  The troubadours liberally changed the number of syllables line by line, creating heterometric structure.   Second, troubadours also revolutionized rhyme, which is simultaneously “sound, sense, and signpost” (Switten, 145). A rhyme contributed to sonority, selected harsh of smooth words, and also to mark inter and intra- stanzaic linkings.  The troubadour used these meter and rhyme as a new technology to influence performance.  For example, in Pierre Vidal’s “Be`m pac,” the rhyme scheme is abbaabccdd.  Switten states that lines 5 and 6 are transitional, lending to both the first and second part of the strophe.  We hear this transition in the live performance posted on the Trobar site.  The performer ends the first four verses in a more monotone or lower note. Then, for the two transition lines, the notes end higher, and in addition, the pace speeds up.  Switten calls this the climax of the melody.  With the “d” rhyme, the sounds reverts back to the lower notes.  The exploiting of the “upper and the lower portions of the range brings contrast” (Switten, 154),  Mixing masculine and feminine rhymes, the rhyme is repeated through each subsequent strophe.  This repetition is interesting across most cansos.  Switten says that the first stanza conditions the rest (Switten, 148).  Containing the melody to each stanza, then replicating this melody is likely a product of familiarity to the melody, because of the non-mensural musical notation, or lack of any musical notations.  While there are no “refrains” in this Pierre Vidal canso, there is also a content repetition, in addition to the structural repetition.  The last two lines of each strophe reference the sacred in a way, citing “Sant Gabriel” (ln 20), “Dieus Abel” (ln 30), and “Daniel and Bel” (ln 59-60).  As read and heard in this “Be`m pac,” Pierre Vidal utilizes the new systems of versification in meter and rhyme.   &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Exploitation in The Wider Sense</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/exploitation-wider-sense</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that Switten’s analysis of the technical structure of the troubadour lyric illustrates the depth of the craftsmanship inherent in these songs. It negates the idea that the performances were simple entertainment and reveals the complex phrase structures and cadence patterns embedded in the lyric. The musical theory, if I’m honest, is a little bit over my head but what I am struck by is this exploitation of system in order to further prove the troubadour’s skill. Switten asserts that the “possibilities of combination and re-combination served as powerful stimulus to troubadour invention of new patterns of verbal sound.” With the emergence of the systems came the possibility to play with them. What the troubadour chose to amend or change is what makes the song their own, and emphasizes it’s poignancy. In the Second Example of The Comtessa de Dia lyric “A chanter” Switten explains, “the rhyme scheme is aaaabab. The rhyme sound a changes with every stanza providing a variety of colours”. The exploitation comes from taking a particular rule, for example a rhyme scheme and shaking it up a little. The troubadours did not take the musical codes as rules but impetus for invention. Switten uses the word “colour” to explain that the Comtessa’s artistic choice to change the “a” rhyming sound in each line is what makes it memorable and pleasurable to listen to. The exsistence of these musical systems in the first place is what allows for this creativity. If the &amp;quot;masculine&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;feminine&amp;quot; ending was not structured, then the &amp;quot;poetic effect&amp;quot; of contrasting them in various ways in music would not be possible. I thought about it in the sense of a chemist creating an art pigment and then the artists using it to create a painting. Is it an exploitation or rather a collaboration between system and creativity?&lt;br /&gt;
	The other part of Switten’s article that particularly struck me was the Performance paragraph. It deals with the pitfalls that occur when we try and recreate an authentic troubadour song now. He seems to be saying that the real issue of performing these songs is whether we, like the troubadours, use what we have of their lyric and use our own artistic license to create something exciting and worthwhile, or do we adhere so “strictly” to the historical notation so that the song becomes “too rigid”. Just as the troubadours exploited the “new sound systems” to create something original, our recreations are forced to “exploit” the remnants of the troubadour lyric noted in manuscript form to create a Performance. I also want to consider the exploitation that Switten raises, of the “preservation in writing” of the troubadour’s song. Switten explains that “we do not know how the songs crossed this gap” “between the creation of troubadour songs” and their being written down in manuscripts. This date gap means that the songs were written down by people who were most likely not the troubadours themselves, who may have imposed their own license onto the lyric. There is a third exploitation then to take into account then; that of the preserver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-course field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Course:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;DLCL 121: Performing the Middle Ages (FRENCH 151)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/response&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
