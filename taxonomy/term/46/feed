 <title>Feminism in Trobar Poetry vs. in Disney Princess Films</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/feminism-trobar-poetry-vs-disney-princess-films</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of my presentation is to identify characteristics of troubadour and trobaritz poetry that could have evolved or been integrated into Disney princess culture.  Some of the characteristics present in trobaritz poetry include physical and sexual attraction and fina amor, or courtly love.  There exists an ongoing debate over whether Disney princess culture is progressive in the feminist eye, but it is not conclusive by any means because evidence used to support both sides is largely anecdotal and subjective.  Examining gender dynamics of courtly love through historical lens provides the perspective of a society that existed centuries ago.  Analyzing trobar poetry and Disney princess films is a fruitful comparison because they both focus primarily on the subject of courtly love.  Although Disney princess films have their historical roots in the Medieval Age, trobar literature covers topics relevant to people and societies regardless of the time period.  Such topics involve sentiments: love, anguish, hope, despair, and longing, which pertain to all human beings.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two poems by Raimbaut de Vaqueira and La Comtessa de Dia illustrate that there is no consensus amongst troubadour and trobaritz poetry.  Additionally, scholars in trobar literature disagree with how progressive these 12th century works were.  Concepts illustrated in these two poems, such as fina amor and a focus on physical appearance are also observed in Disney’s princess films.  The intent of juxtaposing works of art from time periods centuries apart is to demonstrate how certain sentiments are universal, and that the works of the troubadours and trobaritz still are relevant to contemporary society.  &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A Modern Music Guide to the Troubadour Canon</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/modern-music-guide-troubadour-canon</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement of Intent &amp;amp; Methodology A link to the playlist can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/user/1253758515/playlist/2tQuhMDRIoVWMakGQiLivq&quot;&gt;https://open.spotify.com/user/1253758515/playlist/2tQuhMDRIoVWMakGQiLivq &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The object of this creative project is to engage with the conception of Taruskinian authenticity in order to reevaluate how thematic concerns of the troubadour lyrics can be transposed across time. Given that Taruskin’s main point of contention is with critics and musicians who adhere to historical accuracy, it seemed appropriate to create a product that was decidedly not of the troubadour era. The idea behind the creation of a Spotify playlist was to show how the concepts and emotions that troubadour poets stood for were not simply germane to their time and place. Rather, the universality of troubadour lyrics can be found in the way that traces of their linguistic DNA can be found in objects of music that have no stated connection to the world of Ventadorn and Bertran de Born, Vidal and Cardenal.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the project began due to my noting that certain present-day musical artists were often referred to as ‘troubadours’ or ‘troubadour-like’ (Father John Misty, Angel Olsen, Julien Baker) in reviews of their work, I quickly found that simply choosing those artists would be to fall into the Taruskinian trap of equating stylistic recapitulation as authentic historical revision.  Therefore, the project took on a wide-ranging nature, and while the main critical resource I engaged with was Taruskin’s discourse on authenticity, each song has a defined term taken from the course that I see as reflecting the thematic or stylistic concerns we can see in song. These terms can range from critical conceits such as ‘contrafactum’ or ‘philological translation’ to specific poems and poets. In giving each modern song a point of historical comparison, we can analyse how the troubadour lyric has achieved a sort of musical timelessness. Unbidden, we can see elements of almost every part of troubadour poetry in the songs that artists compose today. As such, the prevailing modern trend seems to be a move towards Taruskinian authenticity – songs about love, loss and the possibility of often-erotic consummation have never left the canon, they have merely been reinterpreted.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taruskin, Richard. Text and Act: Essays on Music and Performance. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995. Print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falck, Robert. Parody and Contrafactum: A Terminological Classification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaunt, Simon. The Troubadours: An Introduction Galvez, Marisa. The Voice of the Unrepentant Crusader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Song Blurbs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father John Misty /The Night Josh Tillman Came Over -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taruskinian authenticity – Perhaps no musical artist is a better exemplar of the notion of ‘authenticity’ in music than Father John Misty. Even from the very title of the song, layers of metafictional narrative are brought into play. ‘Josh Tillman’ is Father John Misty’s real name and the name he went by in his previous band, Fleet Foxes, yet this is never mentioned in the song. Instead, we get this portrait of a jaded singer, unsatisfied by his string of sexual conquests. This sexual jadedness and the biting nature of the lyrics (“I hate that soulful affectation white girls put on” makes me laugh every time I listen to this song) is also very reminiscent of the tone of “Companho, faray un vers” by Guilhem IX. The resulting image brings into question what is real when we think of music – is this a real event that happened to Josh Tillman? Is it a fictionalized tale of a real person? Such questions would absolutely align with “authentic performance”. This song’s heart lies not in its supposed realism, but in its portrayal of a profoundly sad romantic encounter.       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angel Olsen /Stars -         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natureingang – Broadly defined, a natureingang is an invocation of the glories of nature occurring in the first stanza of a troubadour lyric. Olsen’s desire to “scream the animals to scream the earth/ To scream the stars out of our universe” indicates a desire to reach that sense of pastoral imagery. The visceral desire to conceive of nature is reminiscent of the opening to Bernart de Ventadorn’s “Can vei la lauzeta mover”, which also uses metaphors of nature to invoke the loss of a presumed lover. By revealing to us the beauty of the natural world, both Olsen and Ventadorn make us reflect on the process of love and how even the merest remembrances in the outside world can leave fresh scars.          &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannah Cohen/Claremont &amp;amp; Julien Baker /Blacktop -         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trobairitz – Both these songs evoke the trobairitz tradition that was led by figures such as Azalais de Porcaragues and La Comtessa de Dia. Inverting the paradigm of male longing, they place the figure of the female in the ground, examining what it means for the female to exists in a place of erotic agency as well as a space of romantic entanglement. No longer does the woman act only as the ‘objet du désir.’ Much like Azalais when she says “tant ai lo cor deseubut/my heart’s in such disarray”, Cohen and Baker talk about their own issues and feelings. They do not succumb to thinking of themselves as the objects in their own lyrics – they are the subject, powerful and linguistically active.         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natalie Prass /My Baby Don’t Understand Me -         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tenso – The genre of the tenso is one of debate – a problem is posed and the poet then comes to a linguistic resolution by reflection upon their feelings, usually in conversation with their object of love. Here, while the loved partner remains implicit, the problems of understanding and emotional comprehension remain. Prass seems to strike at the heart of the main troubadour worry – what if I cannot adequately convey my passion to my love?         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kanye West /Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1 -         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alba/Reis Glorios – A foulmouthed alba, but an alba none the less. From its first lines, Kanye’s track is ensconced within the lineage of the alba. How else can we interpret “Beautiful morning/You’re the sun in my morning babe” and “I want to wake up with you in my beautiful morning.” There’s but a small step from here to De Bornelh’s “queus mi rendes per lejal companhia/to give you back to me in true companionship.” Both lyrics have a profound sense of what companionship means – the comforts of having someone to wake up with and to protect you, insulate you from the outside world. Despite the descent into classic Kanye braggadocio at points, we can still see how, unbidden or not, De Bornelh’s alba form is connected to Father Stretch My Hands. ·        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J Dilla/Welcome To The Show -         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrafactum – “When a melody or whole composition is reused, altered or unaltered, the result is a parody or a contrafactum, depending largely on when it was borrowed.” Such is the definition of contrafactum for Falck. That sounds a lot like sampling to me, which gives me a chance to talk about one of my favourite albums ever. Released just three days before J Dilla’s untimely death, every second of this album is created out of sampled extracts from other songs – a literal collage of contrafactual melody. I could have picked any song on this album, because I love them all, but I thought it was appropriate given the memorial status this album has, to pick the very last song J Dilla put on vinyl. ·        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Smiths/A Rush and a Push and the Land is Ours -         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sirventes – Using the classic structure of British Invasion rock yet infusing it with witty and often blackly comic lyrics, the Smiths used the trappings of their musical forebears to create engaging and well-crafted music that undermined and mocked just as much as it attempted to create catchy and melodic songs. If this dichotomy sounds familiar, it’s because many scholars such as Nichols saw in the crusade lyrics of troubadours such as Bertran de Born. Additional means of comparison are found in the fact that this song uses the metaphor of crusading to make its point about the impossibility of love. “The land that we stand on is ours and it shall be again” – to move from here to the papal justification for crusades is merely to translate the sardonic edge of the Smiths into the religious fervor of the 12th century. And much like Bertran de Born in poems such as, “Bem platz lo gais temps de pascor”, the Smiths do not mince their words for those that “are uglier than you and I.” ·        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord Huron/I Will Be Back One Day -         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unrepentant Crusader – Marisa Galvez describes the voice of the crusader in troubadour lyrics as unrepentant with regards to religious penitence. Instead, the troubadour “avoids this confession and established his penitential intention through the remembrance of the lady.” (116) This use of remembrance as apology is seen in this song, which focuses on the return home to a lover. Despite the singer’s absence, the call is not for absolution, but reconciliation. Secure in the knowledge that he will be back, he can appeal to the lady herself, a “personalized avowal” that “valorizes and authorizes.” ·        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billy Bragg/Must I Paint You A Picture -         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fin’amor – Fin’amor, the concept of honest or pure love for someone in troubadour lyric, is one for which the adage ‘the proof is in the pudding’ was written. Differentiating between the righteousness of fin’amor and the deception of fals’amor is largely of interpreting tonal and linguistic declarations by the speakers of the lyric. There is no ambiguity in Bragg’s paean to his lover. The strength of feeling are such that he can only think to express them in art, to give a new dimension to that which words cannot express. In doing so, he creates a touching tribes that accurately restates the values of fin’amor in a modern context. ·        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie T/Jilly Armeen -         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vollzug – Kuhn describes the nature of Vollzug as the act by which a troubadour attempts to bring about erotic consummation between subject and object. With that in mind, this song is perhaps a Halbzug, to follow Kuhn’s us of German terminology. However, the aspect of unrequited and indefinitely separated love is prevalent throughout this song, as Jamie reflects on the fact that he can only speak of his love under pseudonym. The aching loneliness that pervades this song pervades much of troubadour lyric as well – to see a consummated relationship would be to undermine Minnesang as there would be no goal left to achieve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dd elle/kind 2 u -         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mezura – Simon Gaunt defines mezura as “self-discipline, the ability to moderate one’s passions.” The slightly chaste nature of dd elle’s song mimics this act of linguistic self-control on the part of the singer. To put it very simply, the fact that the singer is faced with behaviour that “turns me on”, he decides only to be “kind to you/” In doing so, he replicates the dilemma faced by troubadours of old – the acceptance of erotic fixation while maintaining a modicum of courtly reserve. ·        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S Girls/the boy is mine -         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation – Pound’s translations take existing troubadour lyrics and recreate them with a new philological persona – in Pound’s case this is the association of crusade lyrics with religious ecstasy. Here, Meghan Remy of U.S Girls embarks on a similar sort of narrative re-fashioning. Covering Brandy and Monica’s ‘The Boy is Mine’, she turns the brooding R&amp;amp;B hit into something much darker, with malice teetering at the edge due to the minimalist instrumentation and dark vocals. While the lyrics (text) remain the same, the character (spirit) of the piece is irrevocably changed. Pound would be proud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Har Mar Superstar/Restless Leg -         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guilhem IX – I highly recommend looking up Har Mar’s Wikipedia page. Doing so makes my description of him as an ‘erotic bard’ make sense. HE takes on the mantle of Guilhem IX, as his songs generally portray him as someone who constantly has a lot of ‘horses in his stable’, to take from Guilhem’s lyrics. Restless Leg, especially, with its portrayal of someone who cannot remain in one place for long, has all the trappings of Guilhem’s unique brand of debauched eroticism. ·        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parquet Courts/Outside -         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melodic simplicity – Using Falck’s guide as a resource once again, it seems evident that contrafactum abounded in the medieval era as a result of the relative simplicity of melody. Therefore, I wanted to include a song that touched on the loss of love (a thematic concern of the troubadours) that also was very basic in melodic structure. Outside has the same riff for much of its two minute running time. It’s also taken from one of my favourite albums of the year, and speaks to the ways we reconstruct ourselves following the dissolution of a relationship. ·        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthur Russell/ I Forget and I Can’t Tell -         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joi et joven - Sometimes you just want to put a happy song that you love on a playlist. The fact that this song happens to be about the sweetness of the first inklings of love and possesses the simple refrain of “Your light is so bright” is just an added bonus. Nothing captures the poetic wonders of finding the ‘joi’ in a relationship better than this song. ·        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deer Tick /Twenty Miles -         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastourella – The entire lyrics to this present a singer who will travel across the desolate landscape in order to reconcile with his lover. We could consider this an inverted pastourella as it makes the landscape barren rather than idyllic, but the essential linguistic gambit is the same. Invoking the concept of the ode, Deer Tick creates a ballad that valorizes a country girl who means so much to the singer that he would travel across all the wilds of the desolate South. Only the nature of the landscape differentiates it from something like Marcabru’s “A la fontana.” ·        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father John Misty/I Went To The Store One Day   -         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troubadour - More than anyone else, Father John Misty was the inspiration for this project. That’s why he opens and closes this playlist. A quick perusal of the reviews of his last album, I Love You, Honeybear, reveals that an assortment of music publications described him or his music as ‘troubadour’ or ‘troubadour-like.’ Why? The answer is seen here, in what I would consider the sweetest song on the album. A simple tale detailing how he met his real-life wife, the track leaves Misty’s vocals nearly bare, with only sparse instrumentation interceding into proceedings, in a matter akin to many of the recordings of troubadour lyrics that we have extant today. The lyrics are heartrending and entirely to do with that most troubadour of topics, the search for love. Finally, at the end of all these tales of lost loves and loves still to come that we’ve seen throughout this playlist, we find a troubadour with a happy ending. Like Guilhem IX 800 years before him, he finds himself reformed, giving up his wild ways in favour of “sentiment re: our golden years.”&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Trap Queen</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/trap-queen</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same vein as Guilhem&amp;#039;s contrafactum, this cover of trap queen converts a famous hip-hop song into a love ballad. It has the same lyrics and melody as the original song, but a completely different video and style. Here, Josh Levi sings with only a piano accompaniment. The camera is centered on him, with no cuts to other people or images - unlike the original music video - showcasing his emotional expressions. The beginning of the video starts out with delicate piano notes.This stripped down cover clearly gives a different interpretation to the original song, which is about having fun and dealing in drugs with the woman in question. For instance, the line &amp;quot;cookin&amp;#039; pies with my baby&amp;quot; refers to cocaine. However, in Josh Levi&amp;#039;s rendition, the same words would now refer to pies of the fruit or nut variety. Other lines have a similar change in meaning. &amp;quot;She ain&amp;#039;t wanting for nothin&amp;#039; because I got her everything&amp;quot; originally intends to show off how much money the artist has, while in the acoustic version, the emphasis seems to be on his emotional devotion to her.  He even changes some lyrics to better fit his cover, such as the switch from &amp;quot;ass&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;face&amp;quot; in the second line, demonstrating that this is indeed an art with new meaning, rather than merely a song sung a different way.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Not Quite A Love Song: These Days and The Royal Tenenbaums</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/not-quite-love-song-these-days-and-royal-tenenbaums</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we see the use of Nico&amp;#039;s version of the Jackson Browne song &amp;#039;These Days&amp;#039; in Wes Anderson&amp;#039;s The Royal Tenenbaums. What is interesting about this scene and what is makes it so moving is that it co=opts the regret that is the prevailing sentiment of the originial song and contrasts it against what we know about these two characters in the film to turn it into a nostalgic lament for a lost love. Much like we see in Guilhem&amp;#039;s crusade lyrics, the ambivalece of the original lyrics is excised by placing the song in a new context. When combined with these gold-tinted images of return, it follows that the viewer of the film interprets Nico&amp;#039;s lyrics as speaking to the desire to return to a blissful state of affairs, despite the fact that this interpretation does not appear in the original song. By transposing the lyrics over the looks of longing exchanged by the two characters, who have carried out a decades-long illicit affair, Anderson gives Nico&amp;#039;s song a haunting beauty. Once again, we could analyse this through the troubadour lens by saying that, in a manner akin to the way that Guilhem&amp;#039;s verses played on his &amp;#039;penitent&amp;#039; persona in order to be used as religious lyrics,  Anderson is using Nico&amp;#039;s persona rather than her lyrics. Nico, as a foreigner and one of Warhol&amp;#039;s muses, was always associated with glamour and beauty, despite the melancholy nature of her music. Using her as the auditory stimulus to think about Margot and Richie&amp;#039;s realtionship in this film make their affair one of romance, of two beautiful and ill-fated strangers. That is to say, this scene is scored with a love song that has nothing to do with love. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ultralight Beam: Old Kanye vs New Kanye</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/ultralight-beam-old-kanye-vs-new-kanye</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultralight Beam Performance &lt;br /&gt;
In Kanye West&amp;#039;s Ultralight Beam we see him taking the persona of a Christian, devoted follower of Christ. We haven&amp;#039;t seen Kanye release a Christian track since &amp;quot;Jesus Walks&amp;quot; from The College Dropout, his first studio album released in 2004. Kanye West has the persona of the celebrity asshole. Someone who is outspoken and who&amp;#039;s ideas are seen as very radical. Also, especially in the early 2000s, Kanye West was heavily associated with the Illuminati so was Jay-Z and Beyonce, which would completely go against his claim as being a Christian. In the video, we see Kanye being very pure and Christian-like with the attire. He also shares the song and spotlight with all those involved in the song, which goes again the popular view of Kanye being very egocentric. We can see a comparison of one going against their popular view with William IX who was seen has someone who was cocky about his possessions and love affairs, however, in his poems he would take a courtly approach using the canso to reveal himself as a nobleman and someone who practices fin&amp;#039;amor and not fals&amp;#039;amor. Both characters here are using art to show their audiences how they want to be viewed despite whatever views the audience might have previously had of them.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Meghan Trainor&#039;s Gap Song</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/meghan-trainors-gap-song</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meghan Trainor&amp;#039;s first music video from her new album, &amp;quot;Thank You,&amp;quot; is a far departure from her previous music videos. This, of course, is the video for &amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; which is set in an abandoned factory with Trainor and her back-up dancers in tight-fitting black or dark work-clothes. The movements are more sensual as Trainor makes it known that she doesn&amp;#039;t want any romantic prospect&amp;#039;s attention right now – she&amp;#039;s just having fun for herself.The music video for &amp;quot;Me Too&amp;quot; comes on the tailwinds of this with a return to Trainor&amp;#039;s signiature bright colors but, importantly, it shows part of the process of the creation of the polished pastels which are (almost) omnipresent in Trainor&amp;#039;s corpus. The lyrics of this song in combination with &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; are very much about Meghan Trainor thinking the world of herself, in a vein not unlike that of Guilhem IX&amp;#039;s gap songs. &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; is about being sought after by others and &amp;quot;Me Too&amp;quot; is about being envied by others. The music video for &amp;quot;Me Too,&amp;quot; however, helps keep this thematic track from moving into self-obsession with its silly visuals to accompany the lyrics. As Trainor sings about being a &amp;quot;sexy thing,&amp;quot; she&amp;#039;s brushing her teeth in her pyjamas, her going-out-top is a giraffe suit, and despite her proclamation that she &amp;quot;don&amp;#039;t need nobody else,&amp;quot; she is still goofing off with friends, softening the implication that she is a loner such a statement might make. The recording of Guilhem IX&amp;#039;s melody as a contrafacture in a religious text shows us that his transformation from boastful to pious was successful (to a degree) with the public. Trainor&amp;#039;s coupling of these lyrics with these images (and her follow-up of &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; with the music video for &amp;quot;Me Too&amp;quot;) makes her boastfulness accessible. It is an empowering one for her and those of us who aren&amp;#039;t her, too.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Deadpool: He must die because I&#039;m too ugly for my lover</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/deadpool-he-must-die-because-im-too-ugly-my-lover</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deadpool was just your everyday neighbourhood asshole mercenary without a care in the world... until he found the girl of his dreams. He pretty much dates her for a long time, gets cancer, goes through this weird operation that saved his life and made him invincible (he only did it because he loved his girl and knew she&amp;#039;d be sad if he died). However, through the operation, he was tortured by his later nemesis Francis who turned him ugly (pic above show his transformation). After breaking out the operation, the story follows Deadpool as he wages war against Francis and all his affiliates because he can no longer return to the person who convinced him to stay alive because he was now ugly. And you know who wants an ugly dude right? Erotic love is seen through the story with the sex scenes and Deadpool&amp;#039;s initial motive to undergo the operation. His inaccessibility to this erotic love post operation is what causes him to wage war against Francis and his crew. The art was justified because Deadpool thought that if he could find Francis, Francis would make him pretty again and he would be able to return to his true love with the face he had when he left her.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Violence and Eroticism in Game of Thrones&#039; New Religious Order</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/violence-and-eroticism-game-thrones-new-religious-order</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#039;t add my picture of Melisandre saying &amp;quot;this post is dark and full of spoilers&amp;quot; (through season 5); consider yourselves warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GamIn Game of Thrones, we are exposed to a variety of religions and many of the new (or newly powerful ones) have been known to preach a rhetoric of violence either to enforce their rules (the Sparrows) or to advance their cause (the faith of the Lord of Light, seen above.)&lt;br /&gt;
The &amp;quot;art&amp;quot; that advances this ideological violence, I would argue, is the art of the Red Priestess, in this case Melisandre. Her art, as she describes in the video embedded above, is her performance of the religion through theatrics. These theatrics justify her having sex with Stannis Baratheon (who is trying to take control of the throne) and his wife (the clothed woman in the video above) accepting that this had to happen. Her sexuality is something that is put on display but can only be accessed when it is religiously necessary. In the video I&amp;#039;ve linked to in the beginning of this post, Stannis decides to burn his daughter at the stake in order for the Lord of Light to bless his troops. The ceremony that Melisandre provides for this sacrifice justifies it to th point where none of the soldiers bat an eye at Shireen&amp;#039;s cries.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sex Dialogue: &quot;What&#039;s My Name&quot; by Rihanna ft. Drake</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/sex-dialogue-whats-my-name-rihanna-ft-drake</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Rihanna&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;What&amp;#039;s My Name?&amp;quot;, we see a dialogue happening between her and Drake mostly on sex but also on why Drake is such a great partner for her. In contrast to the dialogue songs, the conversation here is not shown explicitly has Drake only speaks in the beginning of the song, leaving the rest of the talking to Rihanna. However, one must notice that in Rihanna&amp;#039;s first verse, she introduces the reasons for why Drake is such a good companion for her in terms of sex, which could have been placed at the beginning of the song. If you notice Rihanna&amp;#039;s first verse ends with &amp;quot;let&amp;#039;s explore your talent&amp;quot; which is the same talent Drake describes in his verse. Rihanna&amp;#039;s second verse begins with &amp;quot;Baby you got me...&amp;quot; which is her response to Drake&amp;#039;s verse. Both artists carry half of the overall sex conversation, which is an element of dialogue songs. We can see lines that correspond to sex has Drake says &amp;quot;I come alive in the night time&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;...the things we could do in twenty minutes girl&amp;quot; and has Rihanna says &amp;quot;Not everyone knows how to work my body, knows how to make me want it...&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;You &amp;#039;bout to break me, I swear you got me losing my mind&amp;quot;. Here we see them both in conversation about sex and also the ending as Rihanna&amp;#039;s dialogue as switched scenes to the actual act of them having sex.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Call and Response Rhythms in Dialogue Poetry &amp; Nichols/May</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/call-and-response-rhythms-dialogue-poetry-nicholsmay</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is immediately noticeable in both the alba form (which we could broadly consider a dialogue between man and nature, a protective warding spoken from the noble knight to the sun that threatens to rise), and in dialogue poetry such as Marcabru&amp;#039;s pastourelas is that there is a clear rhythm of call and response, a linguistic interplay that lets each side of the dialogue express there opinions in an almost melodic rhythm. Evidently, this is helped by the music and melody germane to troubadour lyrics, especially given the immensely replicable nature of their musical parts, which leads to contrafactum. In fact, Falck&amp;#039;s affirmation that &amp;quot;when a melody or composition is reused, altered or unaltered, the result is a parody or contrafactum&amp;quot;, could be argued to be applicable across many dialogue songs due to the very similar rhyme and meter schemes. However, that endessly replicable pattern and interlinking duopoly of voices is something that we can also see in one of my passions, sketch comedy. That&amp;#039;s why we&amp;#039;re going back in the archives to look at some forefathers of the American comedic scene in Mike Nichols and Elaine May. Their phone call banter, which made up part of an incredibly popular routine in the 60s, perfectly plays off the dynamic we see in medieval dialgoue songs. As the sketch passes, the pace and the intensity quicken as each individual voice engages in this sort of frantic call and response with the other. When Marcabru&amp;#039;s noble knight states &amp;quot;e no vos cal dezesperar/you have no reason to despair now&amp;quot;, it is not difficult to see traces of Nichols begging May (playing his mother) not to worry about him. The same sense of pleading is there, the same insistent use of voice. Forms like the alba and pastourela are reliant on this sort of dynamic interplay - the tension comes from the divergently expressed conversation rather than from one continuous monologue. A dialogue song has a mode of address (see &amp;quot;per vos mi creys ma grans dolors/ because of You my grief increases) that simply cannot exists in a monological canso. It is the mode of call and response. &lt;/p&gt;
