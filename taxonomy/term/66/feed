 <title>A chantar m&#039;er de so: Comtessa de Dia and the Feminist Ideals of the Trobairitz</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/chantar-mer-de-so-comtessa-de-dia-and-feminist-ideals-trobairitz</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement of Intent: As a performer emerging from a background of theatrical training, I entered this class most interested in the art of performance. However, I also realized that my passion for feminism and feminist studies would intersect beautifully in a further exploration of the trobairitz. As there is only one song with music that has been preserved from the trobairitz cannon, I decided to focus on Comtessa de Dia and “A chantar m’er de so” for my final project. My intent with this project is to analyze the historical context surrounding the existence of trobairitz and use that to engage critically with the text of “A chantar m’er de so,” culminating in a performance of the piece. Methodology and Sources: I used the primary text of “A chantar m’er do so” from the Goldin and the score in the back of Gerard Zuchetto’s text “About Trobar and The Troubadours” to learn the piece for the performance I would be doing with Sandra and the ensemble. I then used “About Trobar and The Troubadours” as well as the text “The Troubadours: The Trobairitz” by Gaunt and Kay to learn more about the historical context of the trobairitz and Comtessa de Dia in order to be able to analyze the song and perform it with the emotional integrity it requires. I was inspired to compare the text on the trobairitz, in particular the Gaunt and Kay text, to modern perceptions of feminism (specifically through the channel of Virginia Woolf’s “A Room of One’s Own.” Finally, I met with Sandra one-on-one to gain perspective about performance techniques that she uses when engaging with this text as well as feedback about my own vocal quality to take back to my practice. I will be rehearing with the entire ensemble this afternoon for the performance this evening.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>La Vergonha and the Future of Occitan Language</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/la-vergonha-and-future-occitan-language</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my project, I wanted to explore how exactly the Occitan language experienced its decline since the time of the troubadours up until modern times. I looked at several secondary sources that examined the place of Occitan in France throughout history, and in addition, I looked at legislature, particularly the French Constitution to find France’s stance on language in the country. I started out by looking into the current status of Occitan in France alongside the presence of Occitan in medieval Europe after the time of the troubadours and Cathars. I then discovered France’s complicated history with language policies, and then furthermore, the attempted, systematic suppression of regional languages during the 19th and 20th centuries. Thus, I focused my project on the complexities of France’s language policies and its attempted linguicide of Occitan and the other regional languages of France. I started off with the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts in 1539 which marked the beginning of the long decline, and I ended with modern day politics, including the political parties in France and also the European Union. Throughout its history, France has tried many times to implement a monolingual nation, and the most effective implementation came in the latter half of the 19th century. Called “La Vergonha” by native speakers, the time period in France was marked by shaming of Occitan speakers, exclusion in the media, and even parents refusing to pass on the language to their children. From 1860 to the present day, the percentage of native speakers dropped from 39% to less than 10%, and the number continues to dwindle today. Despite this however, support from the Council of Europe, the Socialist Party, and popular opinion has led to a revival. The question remains however if this revival comes too little, too late. With less than half a million natives and the encroaching influence of globalization, it is possible that Occitan disappears in another century or two. There has been success in language revitalization across the world, but only time will tell if Occitan is lost to English and French or if it will survive as a major force in southern France.  &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Looking through the eyes of Bertran de Born</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/looking-through-eyes-bertran-de-born</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal Springtime                                                                                           Bertran de Born&amp;#039;s Springtime&lt;br /&gt;
                       &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Bertran de Born: &lt;br /&gt;
was a minor nobleman, though he had his own castle that he used for protection during war times&lt;br /&gt;
fortunes depended on his success in war&lt;br /&gt;
was a spokesman for the noble mercenaries&lt;br /&gt;
disliked times of peace because he would usually be poor&lt;br /&gt;
loved war since mercenaries paid him during this time&lt;br /&gt;
utilized the &amp;#039;sirventes&amp;#039; genre mostly to satirize the ‘canso’&lt;br /&gt;
was crusader as well as a troubadour&lt;br /&gt;
had an interesting view of the youthful qualities (&amp;#039;joves&amp;#039; in occitan) of a man that he showed in his writing style&lt;br /&gt;
In Bel m&amp;#039;es, quan vei chamjar lo senhoratge, Born states &amp;quot;Joves es hom que lo sieu ben engatge&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Vielhs es rics hom, quan re no met en gatge&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
English: &amp;quot;A man is young when he stakes everything he has&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A man is old when he won&amp;#039;t risk a thing&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
In this example, Born is showing his audience that he ties youthfulness with risk and spontaneity without considering the consequences&lt;br /&gt;
attempted to use crusade lyric to reconcile spiritual and material life&lt;br /&gt;
celebrated the ritual beauty and the horror of medieval warfare &lt;br /&gt;
“for war made a man and made money” &lt;br /&gt;
Be.m platz lo gais temps de Pascor:&lt;br /&gt;
Bertran de Born had an interesting Natureingang that switches from a general springtime setting to the setting of war during the spring&lt;br /&gt;
Occitan: &amp;quot;Be.m platz lo gais temps de pascor ... quan vei per champanha renjatz chavaliers e chavals armatz&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
English: “I love the joyful time of Easter … when I see ranged along the field knights and horses armed for war”&lt;br /&gt;
Bertran de Born loved displays of physical strength especially in war&lt;br /&gt;
“I am pleased by a lord when he is first in attack”&lt;br /&gt;
Bertran de Born finds no pleasure in peace since fighting was profitable for him&lt;br /&gt;
“it pleases me when I see strong castles besieged”&lt;br /&gt;
Bertran de Born was pleased because he was about to make a good amount money&lt;br /&gt;
Intentio Recta Argument:&lt;br /&gt;
intentio recta defined in The Voice of the Unrepentant Crusader: “Aler M’estuet” by The Chântelain D’arras by Marisa Galvez&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In taking up the cross, the preacher Bernard of Clairvaux said that crusaders should have a pure conscience (pura conscientia) and &amp;quot;right intention&amp;quot; (intentio recta). Together with other clerical apologists of the Second Crusade such as Peter the Venerable and Ralph Niger, who subscribed to the pilgrimage tradition, Bernard emphasized that the physical imitatio Christi was of little value unless it was accompanied by an internal, spiritual imitatio.  This imitatio took the form of a moral regeneration that was a mark of true repentance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bertran de Born wrote crusade lyric to help influence noblemen to go on crusade, however, by his background and character, we know that making money was his main goal for any war.&lt;br /&gt;
It is known that Bertran de Born loved his material possessions as well.&lt;br /&gt;
In his lyric, &amp;quot;Miei sirventes vuolh far de.ls reis amdos&amp;quot;, Bertran de Born discusses the two kings who want to go to war and are willing to pay heavily for soldiers.&lt;br /&gt;
He continues to talk about the war, saying &amp;quot;lo perdr&amp;#039; er grans e.l guazanhs er sobriers&amp;quot;, meaning &amp;quot;the loss will be great [referring to the dead], but the winnings will be greater&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
In his tornada he says, &amp;quot;mas si.l reis ve, ieu ai en dieu fianza qu&amp;#039;ieu serai per quartiers; e si sui vius, er mi grans benananza, e si ieu muoir, er mu grans deliuriers&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
English: &amp;quot;If the King comes, I put my faith in God I shall be alive or in pieces. And if I am alive, it will be great luck, and if I am dead, a great deliverance&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
From the Galvez&amp;#039;s excerpt, we see that physical imitatio Christi is of little value unless accompanied by spiritual imitatio where imitatio took the form of moral regeneration which marked true repentance, both of these was essential in determining if one truly had intentio recta&lt;br /&gt;
Bertran de Born introduces God in this tornada, saying he will put all his faith in God, he finalizes it by saying if he was dead it would be a great deliverance.&lt;br /&gt;
Born here is showing a little physical imitatio by personifying God but he is also showing that he yet to reach spiritual imitatio.&lt;br /&gt;
All through the lyric he shows his joy in war and the money he will make from it, but he knows the only way he can reach true deliverance with God is if he was to end up dead&lt;br /&gt;
Since Born only proposes him reaching spiritual imitatio in the afterlife, we can assume that he did not have &amp;#039;intentio recta&amp;#039; at least while living on Earth&lt;br /&gt;
Also by his background, I believe Bertran de Born did not have ‘intentio recta’ with regard with crusade since one can argue that while he was on crusade, his intentions were more to pillage, besiege castles, and gain money and possessions instead of to save the holy land&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Contrafactum in &quot;Reis Glorios&quot; and &quot;O Maria, Deu maire&quot; </title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/contrafactum-reis-glorios-and-o-maria-deu-maire</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Link to performance of &amp;quot;Reis Glorios&amp;quot; by TAE&lt;br /&gt;
Link to original source of sheet music for &amp;quot;O Maria, Deu marie&amp;quot; (p. 217) (From Medieval Song in Romance Languages)&lt;br /&gt;
It is believed that O Marie, Deu maire, produced at the abbey of Saint Martial, preceded Giraut de Borneil&amp;#039;s composition of Reis Glorios. Within this chronology, the contrafactum appropriates the melodic structure of a sacred song for a secular one, while retaining the melodic structure. In the case of these two particular works, Borneil also builds upon the specific iconography of O Maria. The editors of O Maria note that the image of &amp;quot;...a serpent/A resplendent angel...&amp;quot; (lines 3-4) &amp;quot;depicts the serpent as Lucifer (the &amp;#039;Light-Bringer&amp;#039;) in disguise.&amp;quot; (p. 18, The cansos and sirventes of the troubadour Giraut de Borneil: a critical edition). The arriva of light underpins de Borneil&amp;#039;s alba, where the lover&amp;#039;s friend beseeches him, &amp;quot;Sleep no longer, rise up quietly,/for in the east I see the star grown big/that spurs on the day, I knew it clearly, and soon the dawn will rise.&amp;quot; (lines 7-10) The dawn, much like the serpent, brings danger, lest the protagonist is not careful. &amp;quot;...do this [wake up], or yours is the harm that will come,/and soon the dawn will rise.&amp;quot; (lines 19-20, p. 195, Goldin) The refrain &amp;quot;...and soon the dawn will rise&amp;quot; is the last line of each stanza. In &amp;quot;Parody and Contrafactum: A Terminological Classification,&amp;quot; Robert Falck stresses the importance of melody in a work as &amp;quot;contrafactum.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;When a melody or whole composition is reused, altered or unaltered, the result is a parody or a contrafactum, depending largely on when it was borrowed.&amp;quot; (p. 1, &amp;quot;Parody and Contrafactum: A Terminological Classification&amp;quot;) A comparison of one performance of Reis Glorios with the sheet msuic for O Marie, Deu maire reveals a similar melodic structure. Falck reminds us, &amp;quot;Indeed, if the melody remains unchanged, there is no &amp;quot;contra,&amp;quot; nothing new to set against the old.&amp;quot; (p. 14, Falck) Thus, the similarity of the two raises the question: to what extent did de Borneil practice contrafactum? &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Separating son and motz</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/separating-son-and-motz</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dillon article explores the relationship between music and lyric, acknowledging that these two disparate elements are usually combined to create a performance, but can be separated as well. On its own, lyric maintains aspects of performance with a rhyme scheme that gives sonality to the verse. Yet because these lyrics are never performed in recitation, only in song, I agree with Zumthor that omitting melody notation does a disservice to the poem. After all, troubadours were both poets and composers. We have looked at their manuscripts with only &amp;#039;motz&amp;#039;, and listened to their performances with both &amp;#039;motz&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;son&amp;#039;. As a result, I would like to explore the third situation, a performance of just &amp;#039;son&amp;#039;. The first embedded video presents a performance of the Cantigas de Santa Maria 163, with both voice and instrumental backing. The piece begins with a jaunty string instrument opening, setting up the melody of the song. At 0:20, the singer jumps in with vocals to the tune of the same melody. By and large, the collection of string instruments follow this singer, matching his tone and tempo. In the second video, a performance of CSM 142, there are no vocals, and so the relationship between the instruments and singer is superseded by the relationship between different instruments themselves. When moving from &amp;#039;motz&amp;#039; to &amp;#039;son&amp;#039;, one instrumental part takes on the classic background role of the orchestra, while the other - a violin at 0:08 - becomes the &amp;quot;singer&amp;quot;. This sole violin always carries the melody, as does the singer in the first video, as if it has a voice.This pattern is repeated across several instrumental versions of troubadour poetry.

 <title>Taverner as the Umpire</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/taverner-umpire</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAVERNER: “Hey, hey, you there! No need for that./ Calm down, Raoul! And you, Connart!/ Let me decide the issue for you./ You’ll both be better off for it.” (626-629)TAVERNER: “What’s this, Cliquet? Is it a fight?/ Let go of him! You too, leave off!/ Go sit down, the pair of you,/ And each will get what he deserves./ Rasoir, tell us the cause of this--/ You must know who was in the wrong.” (926-931)TAVERNER: “What’s up? Pincede, are you mad?/ Let go at once-- you too, Rasoir./ Come over here and sit down quiet./ I know how the quarrel arose./ Now bind yourselves over to me on oath--/ I don’t want to victimize.” (1166-1171) Three times, the Taverner steps in to stop or avoid physical violence in his bar. Three times, the Taverner intervenes with questions about the situations. And three times, the Taverner provides a solution. Why does Jean Bodel place so much weight on the authority of the Taverner? There are other characters in this play that, based on history, should have more emphasis on their dominance. Yet, much of Le Jeu de Saint Nicolas takes place in the tavern, and not, as anticipated in the Prologue, on the topic of Saracen versus Christians. Bodel’s attention to the gamblers and thieves is comparable, if not prioritized, over the crusaders.Specifically, when Connart, the town caller, calls “Oyez, oyez, oyez, good men,/ Your honour and your interests!/ Summons from the King of Africa:/ That all men come, both poor and rich,/ Furnished with arms as is requires.” (225-229), he is calling about the crusades, making a call to war. The audience would have know the reference to the “King of Africa,” and what was entailed when taking up arms. Then, using the same pattern of speech, Connart runs through the “place,” calling ““Oyez, oyez, oyez, gentlemen all,/ Come along, give me your hearing!/ On the King’s behalf I have to tell you/ That as from now his treasure hoard/ Will not be under lock and key” (579-583). Perhaps this is the formula for a town caller, first summoning attention with praise to listeners, then delivering a zealous message. Even so, the parallel of the town caller’s cries hint to the audience the association of crusaders and thieves.When the Taverner resolves conflicts through reason, Bodel is making this direct comparison to solving conflicts of the Fourth Crusade. Could Bodel, who avoids violent battles on the stage, be deterring his audience from political warfare? The signals of battle “King, never, since Noah built the ark,/ Was such an army, such a force,/ As the one which has invaded us” (126-128). He promotes judicious arbitration through the representation of the Taverner. At the same time, the Taverner never missed a chance to turn a profit. For him, the coin is significant, the “ultimate medium of exchange” (Symes, 59).The coin, as described by Symes, is also the manifestation of Paris rule, French expansion, and of King Philip Augustus. With the Taverner upholding banking, forestalling fraud, and umpiring gambles, he represents the position of law and order. This representation positions itself in the framework that Symes describes on symbolic signification. Symes teaches us that the coinage is the material symbol of language. Here, the Taverner is the symbol of fairness and statute.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Performative Utterances, footnotes included! </title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/performative-utterances-footnotes-included</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I find most interesting about the vidas are not the vidas by themselves, but the combination of the vidas with their footnotes. I’m assuming the footnotes are added by troubadour scholars who want to present factual historical biographical information of the troubadours. In this week’s response essay, I want to analyze the vidas and their footnotes through the lenses of Austin’s definition of factual statements and performative utterances. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Austin makes a distinction between ‘statements’ and ‘performatives.’ Statements are declarations of existing affairs and have to be either ‘true’ or ‘false.’ When the vidas give a biographical fact about the troubadour, that is a statement. According to Austin, performatives are speech acts that when said brings something new into existence. Performatives are neither true nor false.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
It is obvious that footnotes constitute as statements, but how about the vidas? Are the vidas performatives or statements (or both)? And what happens when you juxtapose statements with performatives? &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
In most cases the footnotes clarify or flesh out biographical, historical, and geographical information. In contrast, the vidas can be seen as performatives, rather than statements. When a vida hyperbolically says that Falfin D’alvernhe is “one of the wisest gentlemen and one of the most courtly and generous men in the world,” the utterance it not a factual one but a performative one, and not simply because of the claim’s subjective nature. As Burgwinkle explains, “the vidas reveal a deliberate effort to present these varied poets...as part of an ideologically sanctioned system of training....though not all poets and patrons are equally talented and respectable, the honor of the system in which they participate is not questioned.” The claim about Falfin can be seen as a performance of cortezia and the importance of cortezia, rather than a factual argument. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
In these cases, the categorization of vidas and their footnotes are  clear.  But in some cases, the footnotes actually contradict the vidas. In Guillem IX’s vida, the second footnote on Guillem’s line of descent states: “The vida is not accurate on this point” then continues to explain Guillem’s actual lineal descent. When a footnote corrects the vida, does that transform the vida from a performative into a statement? Does it matter if the vida is wrong factually? The point the vida is trying to perform is that Guillem IX has a very noble lineage, and it clearly succeeds. If whether the vida is true or false does not matter, does it automatically make it into a performative utterance? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-course field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Course:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;DLCL 121: Performing the Middle Ages (FRENCH 151)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-project-type field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Project type:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/project-type/critical-analysis&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;critical analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>The Displacement of Love for War</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/displacement-love-war</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bertran de Born verse interested me as it seemed to take the traditional love song, and add an additional layer of intent to the genre. I didn’t feel like it completely abandoned the canso, but used the traditional framework to illustrate an alternate meaning. In this way the Work of de Born was opened up to the cultural Text. In number forty-five, Bertran De Born begins with the Springtime opening that the listener expects to end in the introduction of the troubadours domna. However there is a surprising climax of a different kind with de Born. The “joyful time of Easter” and “the leaves and flowers” introduce “ranged along the field knights and horses armed for war”. Gaunt explains that this kind of song “built on the existing melody and form of a canso, addressing political events and powerful figures directly”. The donma then, is interestingly replaced with warfare; and this displacement is so clearly a simple swapping from one to the other that warfare then becomes eroticsed. De Born using the repetition of phrase “it pleases me” to describe the onset of fighting, explaining that “I have pleasure in my heart when I see strong castles besieged”. The sensual power of the noble lady, becomes instead the violence of war. Gaunt provides some context as to why this is when he explains that De Born belonged to “the inferior segment of courtly society” whose prominence “depended on war” and “languished in poverty whenever there was a prolonged period of peace”. The power of the unattainable woman pales beside the impact that war can have on the lesser nobles fortunes. This new subject matter also lends an heightened intensity to the lyric, especially in the lines “I’ll tell you there is not so much savor in eating or drinking or sleeping, as when I hear them scream “There they are! Let’s get them!”. There is an immediacy and ferocity to the direct discourse, and I wonder how the difference in subject matter would affect the performance of the song. Would the melody still be similar to that of the canto, or would it be a faster paced performance? In view of the text and work dynamic, it is particularly interesting as de Born takes the work of the love song that has “conformed to the work of the author” and broken out of this conformity whilst still staying true to the overarching structure. Therefore it seems as though what DeBorn is doing is more inline with the text as Barthes describes that the “text can be broken” and “can be read without the guarantee of its father” “abolishing any legacy”. However, we can see that the legacy is there in the format but it can most definitely be read without the guarantee of its father, the form being at once broken and kept whole. So we see again, a kind of text/work integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-course field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Course:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;DLCL 121: Performing the Middle Ages (FRENCH 151)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-project-type field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Project type:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/project-type/critical-analysis&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;critical analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Museum Administration in Languedoc Roussillon</title>
 <link>https://trobar-test.sites.stanford.edu/museum-administration-languedoc-roussillon</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are trying to learn about medieval Occitania in Languedoc-Roussillon, a visitor will be drawn to the old castles, cultural institutions like Cirdoc or the various mediatheques, but also to the various regional museums. As an American with some experience in museum programs and management, a lot of the museums we visited struck me as very similar. For our purpose, I will focus on the Centre du Sculpture Romane in Cabestany, the Centre du Chateau des Lastours, and the Musee Archeologique du Narbonne.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
All of these museums had commonalities in display and message which cannot be explained simply by proximity. They were all purpose built museum spaces, either constructed completely from scratch at Cabestany and Lastours, or built into the Palais des Archeveques but with complete remodeled interior decorating. They had strong natural colored wall schemes, either of blond or dark stained wood panels, or earth tones and glass walls at Lastours.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Architecture aside, they seemed to be organized along a similar pedagogical philosophy. There were grottoes or rooms which visitors could walk under or glance at, but never into, unlike at the municipal museum at Castello d’Empuries across the border in Catalonia, which made the physical space of the comital palace an integral part of the exhibition. Miniaturized models of landscapes and and building complexes featured heavily alongside identically designed frosted glass explanatory panels. In the gift shops, they sold the same children’s books about medieval Occitania, bilingual French and Catalan vocabularies, and cookbooks. The inventories could easily have been copied from one another.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
What was the root of this similarity? From my experience in industry, such stylistic consistency is generally representative of a single designer, or multiple designers subscribing to similar philosophies or working with similar collections. The collections were not similar enough to explain this pattern, as they varied from sculptural reconstructions at Cabestany, to historical landscape and ecology at Lastours. The political-cultural explanation would be a common guiding ideology, while the standard free-market explanation would be a common customer base. My theory ended up somewhere in between.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
I first examined the managerial structure of these museums and their institutional histories. They were all built from 2000-2009, more of less complete with their exhibitions, with little planning for temporary or exhibit changes. They were all owned by the municipality, and funded by a mixture of municipal and regional public sector funds. They did not own their collections outright, but were patched together from projects funded by local governments and the museums themselves.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
As such, these museums did not have independent foundation boards. They had only a skeleton front desk staff and maybe two or three directors and volunteer coordinators in the back office. In a typical American museum of similar size, there would be at least thirty full time employees working in educational programs, maintenance of the collection, advertising, and debating internally how to arrange new exhibitions. In the United States, these are considered core museological functions, but in the museums visited, these functions were not undertaken by professional museum workers, but officials in the local government or regional tourism authority.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
In the United States, this externalization of core museological functions would constitute the height of undue government interference. Even ostentatiously public museums like the Smithsonian Institution or the University of California museums have large staffs which take care of these function in-house, and trustees who, although appointed by public bodies, guarantee the independence of museum workers and own outright the entire collection.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
In France however, this doesn’t appear to be the case. In interviews with museum workers and volunteers, the only major complaint that was consistent was the lack of funding for operations costs and the desire for more money from the national government. In regional tourism or municipal officials who made major exhibition decisions, there was no sense that they were they, as policy generalists, were making decisions that should be reserved to museum specialists.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
This attitude, and the concept of a public museum, makes much more sense in the context of the French “Cultural State”. Historically, the French monarchy initially used museums, or public displays of the royal collections, as Renaissance princes would, to impress upon visitors their sophistication and power. After the Revolution, the new republican regime used the old royal collections like the Louvre or the diamond collection to create a national identity. High Parisian culture became French culture, and museums played a key part in a single culture which aimed to be prescriptive, and not descriptive, of France at the time.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
The unusually large budget of the Ministry of Culture, in the hands of a politician, has naturally lent itself to ministers and Presidents of the Republic wanting to make a name for themselves with large projects in the vicinity of Paris. The Pompidou Center, the Louvre renovation, and the National Opera House are all affiliated with particular presidents of ministers of culture. Consistent with its centralizing origins, even today the ministry has little internal institutional checks on the minister. The minister receives as much or as little professional advice as they ask for.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
After the War, a succession of socialist governments attempted to democratize and decentralize the primacy of Paris in France’s cultural agenda. Hence, for the first time, substantial amounts of funding from the Ministry of Culture went to regional tourism authorities, with the expectation that the money “be felt”. Hence, from 2000 to 2009, a succession of very modern museums, with great promises of cooperation with local school systems and extensive volunteer programs were built throughout Languedoc-Roussillon in conjunction with local villes and agglomerations. While Parisian money, coming through the Ministry of Culture and the Region of Languedoc-Roussillon, provided the initial capital investment for the museum, governance, improvements, and management was left in the hands of municipalities.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Hence, today there are a large number of local, public museums in Languedoc-Roussillon. Because they were all built around the same time, they have similar aesthetics and spatial arrangements. Because they were essentially conceived by the regional tourism authorities, they all use local improvisations on the regional brand Sud de France: notre marque. Consistent with the unity of French identity, they do not actively encourage an Occitan consciousness, but instead substitute bilingual French-Catalan childrens books for an air of distinctness. They create the idea of a southern French lifestyle, culture, but also history, which is unique; but in order to attract tourism to the small towns that are the bedrock of the tourism industry, they must also recognize the historical diversity internal to the Languedoc.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
This diffuse brand, in its larger sense, enables Lastours, with its ecological and mining heritage, along with its Cathar and French history, to shine through. It allows the Master of Cabestany and Roman Narbonne’s stories to transcend modern nation-state boundaries, in a different way from the universalism of metropolitan French culture. This is a remarkable example, in the private sector, of an economically successful tourism branding which still allows for the complexities inherent in cultural heritage, or at least as much as the population is willing to support.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
In the public museums studied here, however, they are still dependant on the public sector in a manner that would be considered completely unsustainable in the United States. In spite of their very vocal lack of national funding, regional museums are effectively fully subsidized, and therefore controlled, by the municipality. It allows for for little change in exhibitions, nonexistent museum independence, but also non existent responsibility. Revenue is negligible, as most museums are free, and only the gift shops and tours are charged. They have minimal fundraising efforts, and their greatest weakness is their dependence on the public purse.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
The region built, municipality owned museum is a complete model. Within the context of the French cultural state, it explains a number of the similarities seen in the museums mentioned here, as well as others. It will be interesting to see how the reorganization of the French regional system will affect this system, and if these local museums prove useful or sustainable if further cuts to the non-personnel public expenditure prove necessary.&lt;br /&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I focused on the role of rhythm in troubadour poetry, in particular zooming into the works of Peire Cardenal. Aside from a few exceptions in the late 13th and early 14th century, all troubadour melodies are notated with neumes, which give no indication of rhythm. I therefore wanted to examine the impact of the performers&amp;#039; interpretation of the poems on the meaning of the poems, as well as the structure of the poems as the poet meant them to be. Rhythm is especially important because audiences heard, rather than read the poems. The rhythmic nature of most of Peire Cardenal&amp;#039;s poems can often be likened to chanting or the military, which are 2 main themes that run through his works: the clergy and war. This sound is one that audiences are familiar with, and we know that troubadours tended to draw inspiration from their everyday lives (eg. horses hooves). Repetition of words, syllables, consonants and refrains contributed to the rhythm of the poem, providing audio cues by which audiences could discern the structure of the poem. In #57, the clear structure and rhyme scheme of the poem mirrored Peire Cardenal&amp;#039;s struggle to retain his sanity and rationality in the &amp;#039;mad world&amp;#039; and he, through this poem, positions himself as the true voice of morality and reason in the world that he deems insane after the Albegensian Crusade. in #52, there is a clear use of rhythm variation to reinforce his emotions. The song starts of melodic, with a gentle, unhurried rhythm, but this gives way to a faster, more brusque rhythm as Peire Cardenal expresses his anger and indignation. The use of harsh consonant clusters further complements this effect. Both medieval and modern audiences alike, by simply listening to the sound of the poem, are able to understand his frustration.Therefore, we have demonstrated how rhythm can serve to enhance the message that troubadours tried to put forth to audiences. &lt;/p&gt;
