    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>My project consists of nine sestinas, one for each student in the class. A sestina is a form of poem first invented by the troubadour Arnaut Daniel. A sestina is a poem of six stanzas with six lines each. The last words of each line repeat in each stanza. The first line of each stanza has seven syllables with each following line containing ten syllables. The poem ends with a three line tournada with each line including two of the ending words from the previous stanzas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My poems were inspired by Arnaut Daniel’s poems. Each poem is told from the perspective of a different student, and the goal is to capture their unique voice. I chose six words that are associated with their personality or are related to common experiences or inside jokes. I like how this mirrored the reality in troubadour times when there would be shared knowledge between the troubadour and the audience that would lead to greater engagement with the songs. Many treat the themes of troubadours: music, adventure, far away love.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Literary critic Paul Fussell once commented that the sestina "would seem to be [a form] that gives more structural pleasure to the contriver than to the apprehender” (Fussell). Many have also noted that the sestina may be a more natural and satisfying form in languages other than English. I will concede that creating the poems did make me feel clever, but it will definitely be less interesting to others. I found that accommodating the ending words directed the poem instead of relying on a premeditated theme or story.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was also inspired by poems by Elizabeth Bishop and Kurt Vonnegut who both composed sestinas in English (Ferguson). I looked to their poems for guidance on how to continually reuse words without sounding repetitious. At times, I tried to play with the different meanings of words. For example, I used “bio” meaning “biology,” but I also used it to mean “biography.” I used “desert” as the dry landscape, the verb meaning to abandon something, as well as the rarely used meaning of a group of lapwings.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa: And for what? </strong></p>
<p>See I come from Miami</p>
<p>Soon you will learn that I speak French – barely</p>
<p>I lived in Wisconsin. That was tragic.</p>
<p>But to Florida I returned – thank God</p>
<p>No matter where I am, I’m still yo girl</p>
<p>Now my story comes - so be quiet ma’am</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One day in France, I said “Ma’am</p>
<p>This shit ain’t like being in Miami.</p>
<p>Everything is old ‘cept this boy and girl”</p>
<p>So I hiked to this castle – barely</p>
<p>And when I got there, I prayed to my God.</p>
<p>I said, “Sir, this hiking is tragic.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This story’s really tragic</p>
<p>So you best be listening up ma’am.</p>
<p>This story is all true I swear to God.</p>
<p>I followed some boy here from Miami.</p>
<p>He owns this castle on this hill – barely.</p>
<p>He shares it with six cousins and some girl.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now what was it all for girl?</p>
<p>He treats you like you ugly. That’s tragic.</p>
<p>He thinks he’s got it all. I say “barely.”</p>
<p>He tells me what to do. Excuse me, ma’am.</p>
<p>This shit would never fly in Miami.</p>
<p>I will dump this boy’s ass – so help me God.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But I do love him – Oh God!</p>
<p>He’s running around with some other girl.</p>
<p>And he won’t follow me to Miami</p>
<p>I’m too good for this. This love’s tragic</p>
<p>If he comes back to me, I’ll say “no ma’am”</p>
<p>You had your chance and you took it – barely</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am sure about this barely</p>
<p>If he begs, I’ll ask for the help of God</p>
<p>I’ll tell him to go and he’ll say “no ma’am”</p>
<p>He knows that I will always be his girl</p>
<p>Oh! This whole situation is tragic</p>
<p>I really should have stayed in Miami</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I send this barely song to a girl</p>
<p>Who knows by God that life is tragic</p>
<p>Dear ma’am please take this song and meet me in Miami</p>
<p><strong>Arman: A Mountain Boy</strong></p>
<p>Hark! I am a mountain boy</p>
<p>You might find this fact of mine ironic</p>
<p>I shall now recount my full history</p>
<p>Don’t be reactive – this ain’t chemistry</p>
<p>I might have to pause to grab a bucket</p>
<p>I also might say Bofigliano</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I say Bofigliano</p>
<p>But I still talk to you as I’m a boy</p>
<p>Who can be found carrying a bucket</p>
<p>I also like things that are ironic</p>
<p>And ionic – ‘cause I like chemistry</p>
<p>Time for my tale of ancient history</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I once studied history</p>
<p>Then I met a man – Bofigliano</p>
<p>Then – bam – explosion, total chemistry,</p>
<p>He taught me of the troubadours – oh boy!</p>
<p>And here is the part that is ironic</p>
<p>It even made me put down my bucket</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He said, “Pick up that bucket!”</p>
<p>And fill it with troubadour history</p>
<p>They are gone but still here – that’s ironic</p>
<p>Then I had to say Bofigliano</p>
<p>Although I was still talking to the same boy</p>
<p>This was not in a class of chemistry</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Far greater than chemistry</p>
<p>Is that with which I have filled my bucket</p>
<p>That which enlivens the heart of each boy</p>
<p>The ocean of troubadour history</p>
<p>Far more thrilling than Bofigliano</p>
<p>Please don’t tell me that that is ironic</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is what is ironic</p>
<p>That I wanted to study chemistry</p>
<p>When in the world – Bofigliano –</p>
<p>There are troubadours to fill my bucket</p>
<p>So that is the end of my history</p>
<p>Now I am fully a troubadour boy</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So place this ironic song in a bucket</p>
<p>And forget chemistry and history</p>
<p>For this is a troubadour world and I am a Bofigliano boy</p>
<p><strong>Uche: Y’all </strong></p>
<p>You might expect me to sing</p>
<p>Or perhaps you believe I will dance</p>
<p>But you are sorely mistaken ‘cause y’all</p>
<p>You know that all of that would be nonsense</p>
<p>For I only ever study bio</p>
<p>That is the end of the story – goodnight</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Did you believe that goodnight?</p>
<p>I was just playing with y’all. I must sing</p>
<p>Even though I’m devoted to bio</p>
<p>I will never give up my love of dance</p>
<p>Without dance, the world is full of nonsense</p>
<p>For real though, I wouldn’t do that to y’all</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now I have a gift for y’all</p>
<p>We ain’t driving, so I won’t say goodnight</p>
<p>The gift is a story – this ain’t nonsense</p>
<p>This is a mighty tale that I will sing</p>
<p>If you are lucky I might even dance</p>
<p>This is my vida – Sir Uche’s bio</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will begin my bio</p>
<p>With a story that involves all of y’all</p>
<p>One day I was doing a baller dance</p>
<p>And spinning in circles – but then – goodnight</p>
<p>I was so dizzy that I could not sing</p>
<p>I fell down and passed out – that was nonsense</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But here is the real nonsense</p>
<p>-Don’t ask me to explain the bio-</p>
<p>When I woke up I did not try to sing</p>
<p>Because the troubadours had replaced y’all so then in Occitan I said “goodnight”</p>
<p>Ignoring my words, they started to dance</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This was not a normal dance</p>
<p>They sang a song of nothing – just nonsense</p>
<p>A joglar I became on that good night</p>
<p>A more noble profession than bio</p>
<p>A joglar far more skilled than all of y’all</p>
<p>Now the songs of the troubadours I sing</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So that is my song of dance and not bio</p>
<p>You believed that nonsense? Y’all…</p>
<p>I got nothing to say but goodnight. I’m still premed even if I like to sing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Angie: Hot Troubadour Summer </strong></p>
<p>Here’s a story – honestly</p>
<p>I think you guys will really like it – wait</p>
<p>First, I am having a hot girl summer</p>
<p>That is what we call it in Salinas</p>
<p>I learned about it from friends on Twitter</p>
<p>It means that I’m busy chasing the bag</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So how do you chase the bag?</p>
<p>I can’t answer that question honestly</p>
<p>What happens on Twitter stays on Twitter</p>
<p>So to know that you will just have to wait</p>
<p>My story does not concern Salinas</p>
<p>It is about my troubadour summer</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What a wild whirlwind summer</p>
<p>I came to Narbonne with a well packed bag</p>
<p>It is quite a long way from Salinas</p>
<p>But now I am so distraught – honestly</p>
<p>For my love is far away. It’s true – wait</p>
<p>Who is this far away love? It’s Twitter</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How, you ask, is it Twitter?</p>
<p>It is my love far away this summer</p>
<p>Thanks to Ethic Etape. It makes me wait</p>
<p>Now I have let the cat out of the bag</p>
<p>I long for faster wifi honestly</p>
<p>This would never happen in Salinas</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh wifi of Salinas!</p>
<p>How fast was my connection to Twitter!</p>
<p>Narbonne needs better wifi honestly</p>
<p>This is ruining my hot girl summer</p>
<p>It is impossible to chase the bag</p>
<p>When for every tweet I have to wait</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They load slowly while I wait</p>
<p>I dream of the network in Salinas</p>
<p>Do you think they still use slang like “the bag?”</p>
<p>Or is everything different on Twitter</p>
<p>Now that fall has come to replace summer</p>
<p>This wifi is killing me honestly</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While I wait, I send this song to my love Twitter</p>
<p>Give my regards to Salinas and hot girl summer</p>
<p>I chase the bag, but I do it honestly</p>
<p><strong>Carly: An Awesome Tale </strong></p>
<p>Behold! My tale is awesome</p>
<p>Although it is not as awesome as SLE</p>
<p>You can’t find this knowledge in any book</p>
<p>To find it you must go to a concert</p>
<p>The concert cannot be in Kentucky</p>
<p>Not at a competition of Wushu</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wish it were like Wushu</p>
<p>Because that would be really so awesome</p>
<p>Then I could practice it in Kentucky</p>
<p>Of what do I speak? It was during SLE</p>
<p>That I first attended their sweet concert</p>
<p>This knowledge could not have come from a book</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh tell me! What use are books?</p>
<p>What good is the noble art of wushu?</p>
<p>When I first heard that sweetness in concert</p>
<p>That art was trobar and it was awesome</p>
<p>I learned of the great troubadours in SLE</p>
<p>I’ll introduce the art to Kentucky</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They’ll be loved in Kentucky</p>
<p>I will make them read all of Gerard’s books</p>
<p>I will make them read all the books from SLE</p>
<p>For fun, I will also teach them wushu</p>
<p>That will make Kentucky very awesome</p>
<p>At the end we will have a big concert</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hark! What a splendid concert</p>
<p>We will have Fried Chicken of Kentucky</p>
<p>And on their lips will be the word “awesome”</p>
<p>We will take photos and mike a nice books</p>
<p>Shutterfly is what we use for wushu</p>
<p>I’ll show it to the other kids in SLE</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My loves: troubadours and SLE</p>
<p>Oh the joy of a troubadour concert</p>
<p>I will incorporate tons of wushu</p>
<p>Monopoly property Kentucky</p>
<p>This sestina has become like a book</p>
<p>Which is avant garde. That Is awesome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I send this sestina from a SLE kid to Kentucky</p>
<p>Please come to my concert bearing books</p>
<p>And please remember wushu is awesome</p>
<p><strong>Jackie: Do it for the troubadour  </strong></p>
<p>Can I please have a waffle?</p>
<p>I’m just here in Cedar Rapids chilling</p>
<p>I’ve spent lots of time studying abroad</p>
<p>But know that I’m allergic to peanuts</p>
<p>I hail from the land of California</p>
<p>And I really like a good online meme</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why did I bring up the mems?</p>
<p>For what reason did I mention waffles?</p>
<p>Do you care that I’m from California?</p>
<p>Who cares in which rapids I am chilling?</p>
<p>All of this to you must seem like peanuts</p>
<p>Perhaps I should speak of topics more broad</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why do you not think it’s broad</p>
<p>When I talk about my life via memes?</p>
<p>This is my vida and I’ll say peanuts</p>
<p>If I want – and I do want – a waffle!</p>
<p>Now time for a tale – harrowing, chilling</p>
<p>It starts in a town in California</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Place: Stanford, California</p>
<p>I am no longer studying abroad</p>
<p>Water curtailment – no room chilling</p>
<p>The horror! This isn’t even a meme</p>
<p>I decide to pack up all my waffles</p>
<p>And travel to France, avoiding peanuts</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The flight costs only peanuts</p>
<p>Then I’m in France – not California</p>
<p>I find something much better than waffles</p>
<p>It is the best thing at home or abroad</p>
<p>Someone should make this into a new meme</p>
<p>I saw a group of people just chilling</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Who were these people chilling?</p>
<p>Do you remember Schroeder from Peanuts?</p>
<p>Or Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, the Eagles?</p>
<p>Their best song was Hotel California</p>
<p>Well, I found better musicians abroad:</p>
<p>Troubadours! My support will not waffle</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I send this chilling tale of chilling back to California</p>
<p>Where peanuts never go abroad</p>
<p>And every good meme is about a waffle</p>
<p><strong>Emily: Waitress the Non-Musical </strong></p>
<p>I used to be a waitress</p>
<p>But no longer for I took a gap year</p>
<p>During my gap year I went to China</p>
<p>To and fro, far and wide I did travel</p>
<p>I love to sing; I love to do theater</p>
<p>Don’t get me started on my love of wine</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Today I will speak of wine</p>
<p>Which I brought to people as a waitress</p>
<p>Life is just a stage; the world, a theater</p>
<p>I learned that wisdom during my gap year</p>
<p>Along the path of light I still travel</p>
<p>Did I mention that I’ve been to China?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Such a nice country, China</p>
<p>However, in France, they have far more wine</p>
<p>One thing I discovered in my travels</p>
<p>Is the Broadway musical called Waitress</p>
<p>Have you heard of Broadway? It is theater</p>
<p>The show won a lot of Tony’s one year</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I started Stanford this year</p>
<p>I got to share my stories from China</p>
<p>I went to an operating theater</p>
<p>But the surgeon had had too much wine</p>
<p>House arrest: he can no longer travel</p>
<p>He would have been better off as waitress</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Restaurant Wars: Waitress</p>
<p>That is the name of my screenplay this year</p>
<p>Troubadour troubadour travel travel</p>
<p>These are the words that define me – and China</p>
<p>So please now be quiet in the theater</p>
<p>Listen to my presentation on wine</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wait! I am not done. No wine.</p>
<p>Please bring me another stanza waitress.</p>
<p>Break a leg as they say in the theater</p>
<p>My love is as large as the blimp of goodyear</p>
<p>My love far away, my love in China</p>
<p>One day we will meet. My heart will travel.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have spent many a year in the theater</p>
<p>I have traveled to China</p>
<p>I have tasted French wine and yet I remain your faithful waitress</p>
<p><strong>Isabel: The Walk</strong></p>
<p>Let me take you on a walk</p>
<p>Sit down. Just relax. Grab a cup of milk.</p>
<p>The oasis will come from the desert</p>
<p>For I am the queen of California</p>
<p>Do you catch my drift? Speak my language?</p>
<p>Listen to my story. Hear my bio.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I like to study bio</p>
<p>But I also enjoy taking a walk</p>
<p>Hi or ciao depending on the language</p>
<p>Depending on my mood, drink melk or milk</p>
<p>The golden state is my California</p>
<p>The dessert of my heart is the desert</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Don’t worry. I won’t desert</p>
<p>I only buy products that are bio</p>
<p>Or organic back in California</p>
<p>But listen: you must run and never walk</p>
<p>To the splendid land of honey and milk</p>
<p>That is Narbonne, France. French is the language</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There, music is the language</p>
<p>Listen! You should fly there like a desert</p>
<p>Drink from the full well of troubadour milk</p>
<p>Forget chem; forget math; forget bio</p>
<p>In the footsteps of the troubadours walk</p>
<p>Far from the mountains of California</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh my home of California!</p>
<p>We no longer speak a common language</p>
<p>For I have gone far and wide on my walk</p>
<p>I have traversed field and rill and desert</p>
<p>I’ve seen more than what one learns in bio</p>
<p>There is no stone unturned; no cow unmilked</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So drink with me this fine milk</p>
<p>And do not return to California</p>
<p>Study troubadours; forget your bio</p>
<p>Please excuse me if I use harsh language</p>
<p>Here there is no mirage in the desert</p>
<p>So find your troubadour and start to walk</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Send this song if you drink your milk and speak my language</p>
<p>From California’s desert</p>
<p>To the bio loving troubadour out for a walk</p>
<p><strong>Simon: The Perfect Pitch </strong></p>
<p>I like to drink my boba</p>
<p>And study all of computer science</p>
<p>What come naturally to me is music</p>
<p>Here I stand at the plate. Please throw the pitch</p>
<p>I cheer for my team. I cheer for Stanford</p>
<p>My name, what is my name? It is Simon</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Say my name. It is Simon</p>
<p>I will wait. Say it now or no boba</p>
<p>Say it or my wrath will be felt, Stanford</p>
<p>Magic, love, feelings, bath tub art, science</p>
<p>Look! Here comes the windup. Here comes the pitch.</p>
<p>Bat cracks. Crowd cheers. To my ears it’s music.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am so good at music</p>
<p>Listen, that is why they call me Simon</p>
<p>Simon excels for he has perfect pitch</p>
<p>Are you thirsty? I’ll get you some boba</p>
<p>Love is love is love. It is not a science</p>
<p>I fell in love with a girl at Stanford</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sadly this girl at Stanford</p>
<p>Had a husband who hated all music</p>
<p>Jealousy won over logic, science</p>
<p>He said, “I hate that man they call Simon.</p>
<p>I will kill him with poisonous boba.</p>
<p>Let us see if he dares to hit this pitch.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All I know is life’s a pitch</p>
<p>That is what I’ve learned on the farm, Stanford</p>
<p>So the husband put poison in boba</p>
<p>And when I drank it, I faced the music</p>
<p>And that was the end of the boy Simon</p>
<p>For death cannot be thwarted by science</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But cutting out a heart is not science</p>
<p>And a curveball is not only a pitch</p>
<p>He cut out the heart of the boy Simon</p>
<p>Fed it to his wife, student of Stanford</p>
<p>But first he peppered it. Oh the music!</p>
<p>Oh life! Oh death! Oh my poison boba!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sing this song of science at Stanford</p>
<p>For perfect pitch is more than music</p>
<p>And the moral of the story of Simon is to beware of boba</p>
<p> </p>
